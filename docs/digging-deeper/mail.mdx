# Mail

See how to send emails in Athenna.

## Introduction

Sending email doesn't have to be complicated. Athenna provides a 
clean, simple email API powered by the popular [nodemailer] package. 
Right now Athenna provide drivers for sending email via SMTP, only
but in the future we will add support for Mailgun, Mailtrap, 
Amazon SES, and sendmail.

## Installation

First of all you need to install `@athenna/mail` package
and configure it. Artisan provides a very simple command to 
install and configure the mail library in your project. 
Simply run the following:

```bash
node artisan install @athenna/mail
```

The mail configurer will do the following operations in 
your project:

- Create the `mail.ts` configuration file.
- Add all mail providers in your `.athennarc.json` file.
- Add mail environment variables to `.env`, `.env.test` and `.env.example`.

## Configuration

Athenna's email services may be configured via your application's 
`Path.config('mail.ts')` configuration file. Each mailer configured 
within this file may have its own unique configuration and even 
its own unique "transport", allowing your application to use different 
email services to send certain email messages.

### Available mail drivers

Each mailer is powered by a "driver". The driver determines how 
the mail will be transported. The following mail drivers are 
available in every Athenna application. An entry for most of 
these drivers is already present in your application's 
`Path.config('mail.ts')` configuration file, so be sure to 
review this file to become familiar with its contents:

| Driver name |           Website            |                                            Built with |
|:------------|:----------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------:|
| `smtp`      | https://nodemailer.com/smtp/ |[nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) |

:::note

Athenna has another driver called `fake` that is very helpful when running tests.
The `fake` driver got the same signature of all other drivers, but it don't execute
any operation when calling executors methods like `send()`, which is perfect to use
within the [`Mock`](/docs/testing/mocking) class. For more information
about the `FakeDriver`, take a look at the
[mocking mail documentation section.](/docs/testing/mocking#mocking-mail)

## Sending mail

Let's see the simplest way to send a mail using Mail facade:

```typescript
import { Mail } from '@athenna/mail'

await Mail.from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('user@gmail.com')
  .text('Mail content')
  .send()
```

You can add "to", "cc" and "bcc" recipientes by chaining 
their respective method together:

```typescript
await Mail.from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('user@gmail.com')
  .cc('txsoura@athenna.io')
  .bcc('support@athenna.io')
  .text('Mail content')
  .send()
```

### Sending mail via a specific mailer

By default, Athenna will send email using the mailer configured
as the `default` mailer in your application's `mail` configuration
file. However, you may use the `mailer()` method to send a message
using a specific mailer configuration:

```typescript
await Mail.mailer('my-mailer')
  .from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('lenon@athenna.io')
  .text('Mail content')
  .send()
```

### Sending HTML and Markdown as content

To send HTML as the content of the mail, you can use the `html()` 
method:

```typescript
await Mail.mailer('my-mailer')
  .from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('lenon@athenna.io')
  .html('<h1>Mail content</h1>')
  .send()
```

And for markdowns you can use the `markdown()` method:

```typescript
await Mail.mailer('my-mailer')
  .from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('lenon@athenna.io')
  .markdown('# Mail content')
  .send()
```

### Using view template as content 

The mail component is integrated with the view component to be 
able to render and send a view as the body of the email. To do
so you can use the `view()` method of the Mail facade:

```typescript
const userEmail = 'lenon@athenna.io'

await Mail.from('support@athenna.io')
  .to(userEmail)
  .view('mail/welcome', { email: userEmail })
  .send()
```

### Previewing mail templates in the browser

When designing a mailable's template, it is convenient to quickly 
preview the rendered mailable in your browser like a typical 
Edge template. For this reason, Athenna allows you to return any 
mailable directly from a route closure or controller by using the
`response.view()` method, allowing you to quickly preview its 
design without needing to send it to an actual email address:

```typescript title="Path.routes('http.ts')"
Route.get('/mailable', ({ response }) => {
  return response.view('mail.welcome', { email: 'lenon@athenna.io' })
})
```
