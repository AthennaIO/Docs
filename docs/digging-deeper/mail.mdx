# Mail

See how to send emails in Athenna.

## Introduction

Sending email doesn't have to be complicated. Athenna provides a 
clean, simple email API powered by the popular [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/)
package.  Right now Athenna provide drivers for sending email via
SMTP only, but in the future we will add support for Mailgun, 
Mailtrap, Amazon SES, and sendmail.

## Installation

First of all you need to install `@athenna/mail` package
and configure it. Artisan provides a very simple command to 
install and configure the mail library in your project. 
Simply run the following:

```bash
node artisan install @athenna/mail
```

The mail configurer will do the following operations in 
your project:

- Create the `mail.ts` configuration file.
- Add all mail providers in your `.athennarc.json` file.
- Add mail environment variables to `.env`, `.env.test` and `.env.example`.

## Configuration

Athenna's email services may be configured via your application's 
<Path father="config" child="mail.ts" />  configuration file. Each mailer configured 
within this file may have its own unique configuration and even 
its own unique "transport", allowing your application to use different 
email services to send certain email messages.

### Available mail drivers

Each mailer is powered by a "driver". The driver determines how 
the mail will be transported. The following mail drivers are 
available in every Athenna application. An entry for most of 
these drivers is already present in your application's 
<Path father="config" child="mail.ts" /> configuration file, so be sure to 
review this file to become familiar with its contents:

| Driver name |           Website            |                                            Built with |
|:------------|:----------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------:|
| `smtp`      | https://nodemailer.com/smtp/ |[nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) |

:::note

Athenna has another driver called `fake` that is very helpful when running tests.
The `fake` driver got the same signature of all other drivers, but it don't execute
any operation when calling executors methods like `send()`, which is perfect to use
within the [`Mock`](/docs/testing/mocking) class. For more information
about the `FakeDriver`, take a look at the
[mocking mail documentation section.](/docs/testing/mocking#mocking-mail)

## Sending mail

Let's see the simplest way to send a mail using Mail facade:

```typescript
import { Mail } from '@athenna/mail'

await Mail.from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('user@gmail.com')
  .content('<h1>Mail content</h1>')
  .send()
```

You can add "to", "cc" and "bcc" recipientes by chaining 
their respective method together:

```typescript
await Mail.from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('user@gmail.com')
  .cc('txsoura@athenna.io')
  .bcc('support@athenna.io')
  .content('<h1>Mail content</h1>')
  .send()
```

### Sending mail via a specific mailer

By default, Athenna will send email using the mailer configured
as the `default` mailer in your application's `mail` configuration
file. However, you may use the `mailer()` method to send a message
using a specific mailer configuration:

```typescript
await Mail.mailer('my-mailer') ðŸ‘ˆ
  .from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('lenon@athenna.io')
  .content('Mail content')
  .send()
```

### Sending Text and Markdown as content

To send text as the content of the mail, you can set the 
`type` property in second argument:

```typescript
await Mail.mailer('my-mailer')
  .from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('lenon@athenna.io')
  .content('Mail content', { type: 'text' }) ðŸ‘ˆ
  .send()
```

And for markdowns you can use the `markdown` type:

```typescript
await Mail.mailer('my-mailer')
  .from('support@athenna.io')
  .to('lenon@athenna.io')
  .content('# Mail content', { type: 'markdown' }) ðŸ‘ˆ
  .send()
```

### Using view template as content 

The mail component is integrated with the view component to be 
able to render and send a view as the body of the email. To do
so you can use the `view()` method of the Mail facade:

```typescript
const userEmail = 'lenon@athenna.io'

await Mail.from('support@athenna.io')
  .to(userEmail)
  .cc('mailer1@athenna.io, mailer2@athenna.io')
  .bcc('mailer3@athenna.io, mailer4@athenna.io')
  .content('This is the mail body')
  .view('mail/welcome', { email: userEmail }) ðŸ‘ˆ
  .send()
```

Any data that you provide using the `Mail` facade will be
available to you in your view:

```html title="Path.views('mail/welcome.edge')"
<!-- Provided by you when using Mail facade methods -->
<h1>{{ to }}</h1>
<h1>{{ cc }}</h1>
<h1>{{ bcc }}</h1>
<h1>{{ from }}</h1>
<h1>{{ content }}</h1>

<!-- Provided by you second argument -->
<h1>{{ email }}</h1>
```

:::tip

You can overwrite data set by `Mail` facade by defining it
in the second argument object:

```typescript
const userEmail = 'lenon@athenna.io'

await Mail.from('support@athenna.io')
  .to(userEmail)
  .cc('mailer1@athenna.io, mailer2@athenna.io')
  .bcc('mailer3@athenna.io, mailer4@athenna.io')
  .content('This is the mail body')
  .view('mail/welcome', { 
    email: userEmail, 
    to: 'txsoura@athenna.io' ðŸ‘ˆ
  })
  .send()
```

### Previewing mail templates in the browser

When designing a mailable's template, it is convenient to quickly 
preview the rendered mailable in your browser like a typical 
Edge template. For this reason, Athenna allows you to return any 
mailable directly from a route using the `Route.view()` method, 
allowing you to quickly preview its  design without needing to 
send it to an actual email address:

```typescript title="Path.routes('http.ts')"
Route.view('/mailable', 'mail/welcome', { email: 'lenon@athenna.io' })
```
