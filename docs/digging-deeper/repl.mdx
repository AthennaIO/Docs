# REPL

See how to create a REPL session with Athenna Framework ecosystem.

## Introduction

From [Digital ocean article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-repl): 
A Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, is a computer environment 
where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results 
are returned to the user. REPLs provide an interactive 
environment to explore tools available in specific environments 
or programming languages. Some examples include the Node.js 
console, IPython, the Bash shell, and the developer console 
found in most web browsers.

Athenna can easily integrate with 
[`node:repl`](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl) package 
to run your entire infrastructure in parallel with the package.

## Booting REPL

REPL allows you to interact with your entire Athenna 
application on the command line, including your models,
jobs, events, and more. To enter the REPL environment, 
run the Artisan command:

```shell
node artisan repl
```

:::info

When running this command, Athenna will use the 
`Path.bootstrap('repl.ts')` file to execute your session.

:::

## Importing modules in REPL session

To import modules inside REPL you need to use dynamic imports:

```typescript
{ Log } = await import('@athenna/logger') // Destructuring import
helpers = await import('#app/helpers/index') // Default import
```

:::caution

If you don't use `var/let/const` in front of your importation, 
the variable will be set globally in your REPL session.

:::

:::tip

You can check the global context of your REPL session 
running `.ls`. You can type `.help` to check all REPL 
commands available.

:::

## Extending REPL Context

When running your REPL session, it could be painful to
keep declaring the same variables over and over again. To
avoid that you can use the `repl.setIntContext()` method,
and it will be available in all your REPL sessions:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('repl.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, { bootLogs: false })

const repl = await ignite.repl()

repl.setInContext('helloWorld', 'Hello World!')
repl.setInContext('appService', ioc.safeUse('App/Services/AppService'))
```

## Custom REPL commands

You can create custom REPL commands like `.ls` and `.clean`
to make your life easier when running your REPL session:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('repl.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, { bootLogs: false })

const repl = await ignite.repl()

repl
    .command('greet')
    .help('Greet someone')
    .action(function action(name: string) {
        this.clearBufferedCommand()
        console.log(`Hello ${name}!`)
        this.displayPrompt()
    })
    .register()
```

Now the `.greet` command will always be available in your
REPL sessions:

```shell
.greet Antoine
> Hello Antoine!
```

## Pre-importing modules

### Pre-importing module

Like declaring variables in the REPL context, it could be painful
to import modules in your everytime in your REPL sessions. To avoid
it you can use the `repl.import()` method:

```typescript
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, { bootLogs: false })

const repl = await ignite.repl()

await repl.import('common', '@athenna/common')
```

Now you are able to use the `common` variable in your REPL sessions:

```typescript
common.Path.pwd()
```

### Pre-importing modules names as keys

Sometimes a module exports a variety of classes, functions, etc.
Like `@athenna/common`, that exports a variety of helpers, and would
be easier if we could directly use the helper name instead
of the `common` variable as we have created in the example above.
With `repl.importAll()` you can import the module names as keys to
the REPL context:

```typescript
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, { bootLogs: false })

const repl = await ignite.repl()

await repl.importAll('@athenna/common')
```

Now you are able to use the `Path` helper directly in your REPL sessions:

```typescript
Path.pwd()
```

:::info

By default, your `Path.bootstrap('repl.ts')` file already
imports all the `@athenna/common` helpers to your REPL session ðŸ¤©.
