# REPL

See how to create a REPL session with Athenna Framework ecosystem.

## Introduction

From [Digital ocean article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-repl): 
A Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, is a computer environment 
where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results 
are returned to the user. REPLs provide an interactive 
environment to explore tools available in specific environments 
or programming languages. Some examples include the Node.js 
console, IPython, the Bash shell, and the developer console 
found in most web browsers.

Athenna can easily integrate with 
[`node:repl`](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl) package 
to run your entire infrastructure in parallel with the package.

## Booting REPL

REPL allows you to interact with your entire Athenna 
application on the command line, including your models,
jobs, events, and more. To enter the REPL environment, 
run the Artisan command:

```shell
./node artisan repl
```

:::info

When running this command, Athenna will use the 
`Path.bootstrap('repl.ts')` file to execute your session.

:::

## Importing modules in REPL session

To import modules inside REPL you need to use dynamic imports:

```typescript
{ Log } = await import('@athenna/logger') // Destructuring import
helpers = await import('#app/helpers/index') // Default import
```

:::caution

If you don't use `var/let/const` in front of your importation, 
the variable will be set globally in your REPL session.

:::

:::tip

You can check the global context of your REPL session 
running `.ls`. You can type `.help` to check all REPL 
commands available.

:::

## Pre-importing modules

You can pre-import modules in your REPL session to avoid keep
importing them everytime inside your REPL session. You can do that
in your `Path.bootstrap('repl.ts')` file:

```typescript
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, { bootLogs: false })

const repl = await ignite.repl()

await import('@athenna/common').then(common => {
  Object.keys(common).forEach(key => (
    repl.context[key] = common[key] ðŸ‘ˆ
  ))
})

repl.context.helloWorld = 'Hello World!' ðŸ‘ˆ
repl.context.appService = ioc.safeUse('App/Services/AppService') ðŸ‘ˆ
```

:::info

As you can see in the implementation above, by default Athenna
pre-imports all the `@athenna/common` helpers to your REPL session.
