# Graceful Shutdown

See how to graceful shutdown any kind of Athenna application.

## Introduction

Graceful shutdown means that the OS (operating system) 
can safely shutdown its processes and close all connections, 
however long that takes. This helps to prevent accidental 
data loss or other unexpected problems if the shutdown is 
performed intentionally by the user. To understand how 
graceful shutdown works, you need to have a little bit of 
knowledge about how the [signal events](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#signal-events) 
works and when they trigger.

Athenna already comes with a graceful shutdown mechanism
configured for you out of the box. However, just like 
any other thing in this framework, you can customize it
to your needs. We will see further in this documentation
how to operate with this mechanism and also how to customize 
it.

## Default behavior

Athenna only listen to `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signal events 
by default, this is what is executed when they are triggered:

```typescript
process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  process.exit()
})

process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  await LoadHelper.shutdownProviders()

  process.kill(process.pid, signal)
})
```

:::info

- **`SIGINT`** - Triggered when the user presses `CTRL + C` in the terminal.
- **`SIGTERM`** - Triggered when the machine sends a `SIGTERM` signal to the 
process, this is the default signal created by `kill` or `killall` commands.

:::

## The `LoadHelper.shutdownProviders()` method

This method is responsible for calling the `shutdown()` 
method of all your service providers. Let's see the implementation
of `HttpServerProvider` to understand how it works:

```typescript
import { ServiceProvider } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { ServerImpl } from '#src/server/ServerImpl'

export class HttpServerProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  public register() {
    this.container.instance('Athenna/Core/HttpServer', new ServerImpl(), false)
  }

  public async shutdown() {
    const Server = this.container.use<ServerImpl>('Athenna/Core/HttpServer')

    if (!Server) {
      return
    }

    if (!Server.isListening) {
      return
    }

    await Server.close()
  }
}
```

As you can see, the `shutdown()` method of this 
provider first verifies if the `Server` instance
exists in the service container and if it's listening 
and them close it.

:::caution

If you wish to implement your own `SIGTERM` event, always
remember that is your responsibility to call the 
`LoadHelper.shutdownProviders()` method, if you don't call it
Athenna will never graceful shutdown.

## Customizing

Node.js supports registering as many as signals event 
listeners you want, this means that you can use the default
`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` listeners of Athenna and also create 
your own. We recommend doing this implementation in the bootstrap
file of your like application:

```typescript filename="Path.bootstrap('main.js')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url)

await ignite.httpServer()

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  console.log('executing SIGINT')
})

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('executing SIGTERM')
})
```

If you wish to remove or change the default listeners of
Athenna, or also listen to new signals, you can create 
the `signals` property in the `Path.config('app.js')`
file:

```typescript
import { LoadHelper } from '@athenna/ioc'

export default {
  signals: {
    SIGINT: () => {
      console.log('executing SIGINT')

      process.exit()
    },
    SIGTERM: async () => {
      console.log('executing SIGTERM')

      await LoadHelper.shutdownProviders()

      process.kill(process.pid, signal)
    },
    // NEW SIGNAL
    SIGKILL: async () => {
      console.log('executing SIGKILL')
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

To "remove" the default listeners, just implement a NOOP 
function in `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, because if you remove 
the key or let it `undefined`, Athenna will use the default:

```typescript
export default {
  signals: {
    SIGINT: () => {},
    SIGTERM: () => {},
  }
}
```
