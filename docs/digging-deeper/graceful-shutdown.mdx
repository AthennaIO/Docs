## Introduction {#id-introduction}

Graceful shutdown means that the OS (operating system) can safely shut down its processes and close all connections, however long that takes.
This helps to prevent accidental data loss or other unexpected problems if the shutdown is performed intentionally by the user.

## Configurations {#id-configuration}

Athenna already comes with graceful shutdown configured by default using the `gracefulShutdown` object in `config/app.js` file. In this
object you can configure all [`SIGNALS`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-process-signal-events/) that Node.js process will listen for in your application. Athenna comes with `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`
already configured by default:

```javascript
import { ProviderHelper } from '@athenna/core'

gracefulShutdown: {
    SIGINT: async () => {
      await ProviderHelper.shutdownAll(false)

      process.exit()
    },
    SIGTERM: async signal => {
      await ProviderHelper.shutdownAll()

      process.kill(process.pid, signal)
    },
},
```

It's imperative that you always call the `ProviderHelper.shutdownAll()` method in your signals configurations. This method is who will
call the `shutdown` method of Athenna providers.

## Disabling graceful shutdown {#id-disabling-graceful-shutdown}

To disable the graceful shutdown of some SIGNAL you can just remove it from `gracefulShutdown` object in `config/app.js`:

```javascript
gracefulShutdown: {}
```
