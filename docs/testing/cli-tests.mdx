# CLI Testing

See how to create tests for CLI applications in Athenna.

## Introduction

Athenna provides a very fluent API for running CLI 
commands of your application and examining the output. 
For example, take a look at the e2e test defined below:

```typescript
import { Test, type Context } from '@athenna/test'

export default class ExampleTest {
  @Test()
  public async 'test successful output'({ command }: Context) {
    const output = await command.run('app')

    output.assertSucceeded()
  }
}
```

The `command.run()` method will run a child process using the 
`Path.bootstrap('artisan.ts')` file to execute the `app` command
and get the `stdout`, `stderr` and `exitCode` outputs,
while the `assertSucceeded()` method asserts that the returned 
output should have a successful exit code (`0`). In addition 
to this simple assertion, Athenna also contains a variety of 
assertions for inspecting the output.

## Registering `command` plugin

The `command` property in your test context will only be 
available if you register the command plugin within the 
`Runner` class. By default your Athenna application already 
comes with the command plugin registered. But we are 
going to cover how to register it manually if needed.

Just call the `Runner.addPlugin()` static method to setup 
the request plugin imported from `@athenna/artisan/testing/plugins`:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('test.ts')"
import { request } from '@athenna/http/testing/plugins'
import { command } from '@athenna/artisan/testing/plugins'
import { Runner, assert, specReporter } from '@athenna/test'

await Runner.setTsEnv()
  .addPlugin(assert())
  .addPlugin(request())
  .addPlugin(command()) 👈
  .addReporter(specReporter())
  .addPath('tests/e2e/**/*.ts')
  .addPath('tests/unit/**/*.ts')
  .setCliArgs(process.argv.slice(2))
  .setGlobalTimeout(5000)
  .run()
```

## Running commands

To run a command to your application, you may invoke the 
`command.run()` method within your test.

This method will return a `TestOutput` instance, which 
provides a 
[variety of helpful assertions](/docs/testing/cli-tests#output-assertions) 
that allow you to inspect your application's CLI output:

```typescript
import { Test, type Context } from '@athenna/test'

export default class ExampleTest {
  @Test()
  public async testBasicCommand({ command }: Context) {
    const output = await command.run('greet')

    output.assertExitCode(0)
  }
}
```

## Changing Artisan file path

As mentioned previously, the `command.run()` method invokes 
a child process using the `Path.bootstrap('artisan.ts')` file.
But for some reason you may want to change which file should be 
used to test your commands. To do so, you can call the 
`TestCommand.setArtisanPath()` static method before running
your tests:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('test.ts')"
import { request } from '@athenna/http/testing/plugins'
import { command, TestCommand } from '@athenna/artisan/testing/plugins'
import { Runner, assert, specReporter } from '@athenna/test'

TestCommand.setArtisanPath(Path.fixtures('artisan.ts')) 👈

await Runner.setTsEnv()
  .addPlugin(assert())
  .addPlugin(request())
  .addPlugin(command())
  .addReporter(specReporter())
  .addPath('tests/e2e/**/*.ts')
  .addPath('tests/unit/**/*.ts')
  .setCliArgs(process.argv.slice(2))
  .setGlobalTimeout(5000)
  .run()
```

## Debugging outputs

After executing a test command to your application, 
the output returned will contain the `output` property 
inside with all the `output` data:

```typescript
import { Test, type Context } from '@athenna/test'

export default class ExampleTest {
  @Test()
  public async testBasicCommand({ command }: Context) {
    const output = await command.run('/')

    console.log(output.output.stdout)
    console.log(output.output.stderr)
    console.log(output.output.exitCode)

    output.assertExitCode(0)
  }
}
```

## Output assertions

Athenna's `TestOutput` class provides a variety of custom 
assertion methods that you may utilize when testing your 
application. These assertions may be accessed on the 
output that is returned by the `command.run()` test method:

- [`assertExitCode()`](/docs/testing/cli-tests#assertexitcode)
- [`assertSucceeded()`](/docs/testing/cli-tests#assertsucceeded)
- [`assertFailed()`](/docs/testing/cli-tests#assertfailed)
- [`assertLogged()`](/docs/testing/cli-tests#assertlogged)
- [`assertLogMatches()`](/docs/testing/cli-tests#assertlogmatches)

#### `assertExitCode()`

Assert the exit code of the output:

```typescript
output.assertExitCode(0)
output.assertIsNotExitCode(1)
```

:::tip

The `0` exit code means a successful exit of the command,
anything different then `0` means an error.

:::

#### `assertSucceeded()`

Assert the command exits with `0` exit code:

```typescript
output.assertSucceeded()
```

#### `assertFailed()`

Assert the command exits with anything different 
from `0` exit code:

```typescript
output.assertFailed()
```

#### `assertLogged()`

Assert the command has logged the expected message:

```typescript
output.assertLogged('Hello World!')
```

This method validates that the log message will be
printed in `stdout` or `stderr`. To force the stream type
where this log should appears you can set it as second 
argument:

```typescript
output.assertLogged('Hello World!', 'stdout') // or stderr
```

#### `assertLogMatches()`

Assert the command has logged a message that matches
the [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) 
provided:

```typescript
output.assertLogMatches(/Hello World/)
```

This method validates that the regex will match in `stdout` 
or `stderr`. To force the stream type
where this log should match you can set it as second 
argument:

```typescript
output.assertLogMatches(/Hello World/, 'stdout') // or stderr
```
