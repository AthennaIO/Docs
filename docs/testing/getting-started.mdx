# Getting Started

See how to create tests in an Athenna application.

## Introduction

Athenna is built with testing in mind. In fact, 
support for testing with [Japa](https://japa.dev) is included out 
of the box. The framework also ships with convenient 
helper methods that allow you to expressively test 
your applications.

By default, your application's `tests` directory 
contains two directories: 

- `e2e` - Should contains the tests responsible to test
a larger portion of your code, including how several
object interact with each other or even a full HTTP
request to a JSON endpoint.
- `unit` - Should contains the tests responsible to test
isolated portion of your code, focusing on a single method.
Tests within your **unit** test directory should not boot
your Athenna application, meaning that they should be unable 
to access your application's database or other framework 
services.

The `e2e/AppControllerTest.ts` and 
`unit/AppServiceTest.ts` files are provided for you
to use as an example to start writing your own tests. After
installing a new Athenna application, execute the following
to run your tests:

```bash
node artisan test
```

## Environment

By default Athenna comes set with the 
[configuration environment](/docs/getting-started/configuration)
as `test`, meaning that the `.env.test` file will be used when
running your tests.

You are free to define other testing environment value. To do 
that you can simply change the `setAppEnv()` method of `Runner` class 
in your `Path.bootstrap('test.ts')` file:

```typescript
import { Runner } from '@athenna/test'
import { request } from '@athenna/http/testing/plugins'
import { command } from '@athenna/artisan/testing/plugins'

await Runner.setTsEnv()
  .setAppEnv('testing') ðŸ‘ˆ
  .addAssertPlugin()
  .addPlugin(request())
  .addPlugin(command())
  .addPath('tests/e2e/**/*.ts')
  .addPath('tests/unit/**/*.ts')
  .setCliArgs(process.argv.slice(2))
  .setGlobalTimeout(5000)
  .run()
```

:::tip

You can also use the `--env` flag to set the environment:

```bash
node artisan test --env testing
```

:::

## Writing tests

To create a new test case, use the `make:test` Artisan
command. By default, tests will be placed in the `tests/e2e` 
directory:

```bash
node artisan make:test UserTest
```

If you would like to create a test within the `tests/unit` 
directory, you may use the `--unit` option when executing 
the `make:test` command:

```bash
node artisan make:test UserTest --unit
```

:::tip

You can also create a custom test for each specific 
Athenna application:

```bash title="For REST API"
node artisan make:test UserTest --rest
```

```bash title="For CLI"
node artisan make:test UserTest --console
```

To customize the test templates check the 
[`template:customize`](/docs/the-basics/views#customizing-make-commands-templates) 
command.

:::

Once the test has been generated, you may define your
test methods and annotate them with the `@Test()` annotation:

```typescript
import { Test, type Context } from '@athenna/test'

export default class ExampleTest {
  @Test()
  public async testBasicExample({ assert }: Context) {
    assert.equal(1 + 1, 2)
  }
}
```

## Tests structure

Athenna tests are represented as classes. Your class name will
be used as the test suite name, while the test methods will be
considered the test names. All the methods of the class are
customizable, what defines if that method is a test, test hook
or even a helper method is the annotation used:

```typescript
import { 
  Test, 
  BeforeAll, 
  BeforeEach, 
  AfterAll, 
  AfterEach, 
  type Context 
} from '@athenna/test'

export default class SumTest {
  public sum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b
  }

  @BeforeAll()
  public async beforeAll() {
    //
  }

  @AfterAll()
  public async afterAll() {
    //
  }

  @BeforeEach()
  public async beforeEach() {
    //
  }

  @AfterEach()
  public async afterEach() {
    //
  }

  @Test()
  public async 'should be considered a test!' ({ assert }: Context) {
    assert.equal(this.sum(1, 1), 2)
  }
}
```

### `@Test()`

The `@Test()` annotation is used to define a method 
as a test:

```typescript
@Test()
public async testMethod({ assert }: Context) {
  assert.equal(1 + 1, 2)
}
```

You can also define the test name by passing a string 
to the `@Test()` annotation:

```typescript
@Test('test method!')
public async testMethod({ assert }: Context) {
  assert.equal(1 + 1, 2)
}
```

:::tip

This could also be done in class defining the 
method name as string:

```typescript
@Test()
public async 'test method!' ({ assert }: Context) {
  assert.equal(1 + 1, 2)
}
```

:::

### `@BeforeAll()`

The `@BeforeAll()` annotation is used to define that a
method should be executed **before all** tests of that class
**starts running**. You can define as many as you want in the
same class:

```typescript
@BeforeAll()
public async doSomeOp() {
  //
}

@BeforeAll()
public async doOtherOp() {
  //
}
```

### `@BeforeEach()`

The `@BeforeEach()` annotation is used to define that a
method should be executed **before each** tests of that class
**starts running**. You can define as many as you want in the
same class:

```typescript
@BeforeEach()
public async doSomeOp() {
  //
}

@BeforeEach()
public async doOtherOp() {
  //
}
```

### `@AfterAll()`

The `@AfterAll()` annotation is used to define that a
method should be executed **after all** tests of that class
**ends running**. You can define as many as you want in the
same class:

```typescript
@AfterAll()
public async doSomeOp() {
  //
}

@AfterAll()
public async doOtherOp() {
  //
}
```

### `@AfterEach()`

The `@AfterEach()` annotation is used to define that a
method should be executed **after each** tests of that class
**ends running**. You can define as many as you want in the
same class:

```typescript
@AfterEach()
public async doSomeOp() {
  //
}

@AfterEach()
public async doOtherOp() {
  //
}
```

## Running tests

To run your tests you can use the `test` Artisan command:

```bash
node artisan test
```

Any arguments that can be passed to [Japa](https://japa.dev), 
may also be passed to the Artisan `test` command:

```bash
node artisan test --groups="MyClassTest" --force-exit
```

## Assertions

Athenna ships with a variety of helpful assertions with the
help of the [`@japa/assert`](https://japa.dev/docs/plugins/assert) 
plugin. We are not going to cover
the assertions here, but you can check the [assert documentation
section](https://japa.dev/docs/plugins/assert#assert-1) of Japa to 
see all the available methods for you.

Their documentation is beautiful, small and precise. I swear it
will be worth your time ðŸ˜Ž.

## Other useful annotations

Along with the annotations seen above, Athenna ships with
other useful annotations that can be used to customize how
your test is going to behave. You can check all of them and
it options in the [testing annotations documentation section](/docs/testing/annotations)

## Reporting test coverage

When running your application tests, you may want to 
determine whether your test cases are actually covering 
the application code and how much application code is 
used when running your tests. 

To accomplish this, you may use the [`c8`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8) 
tool that already comes installed and configured for 
you in your application. To use it, you just need to 
call it before invoking the `test` command:

```bash
npx c8 node artisan test
```

:::note

By default, Athenna already comes with the `test:coverage`
npm script defined that already does this job for you:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

:::

## Creating base test classes

If you would like to define some helper methods to be defined
in all your test classes, you can create a base test class and extend
it in your tests:

```typescript title="tests/helpers/BaseTest.ts"
import { BeforeAll } from '@athenna/test'

export class BaseTest {
  @BeforeAll()
  public async beforeAll() {
    console.log('Executed before all tests that extends BaseTest!')
  }

  public getMockedData() {
    return {
      name: 'Lenon'
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript title="tests/e2e/UserTest.ts"
import { Test, type Context } from '@athenna/test'
import { BaseTest } from '#tests/helpers/BaseTest'

export default class UserTest extends BaseTest {
  @Test()
  public async test({ assert }: Context) {
    const data = this.getMockedData()

    assert.equal(data.name, 'Lenon')
  }
}
```
