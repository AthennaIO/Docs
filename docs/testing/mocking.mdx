# Mocking

Understand how to mock dependencies and functions in Athenna.

## Introduction

When testing Athenna applications, you may wish to "mock" 
certain aspects of your application, so they are not actually
executed during a given test. For example, when testing a 
controller that calls a service, you may wish to mock the 
service, so they are not actually executed during the test.
This allows you to only test the controller's HTTP response 
without worrying about the execution of the service since 
the service can be tested in their own test case.

## Mocking API

### The `Mock::when()` method

This method is responsible for mocking the return
value of a given object method:

```typescript
import { Test, Mock, type Context, AfterEach } from '@athenna/test'

export default class MockTest {
  public object = {
    hello: () => undefined
  }

  @AfterEach()
  public afterEach() {
    Mock.restoreAll()
  }

  @Test()
  public async shouldBeAbleToMockAnObjectMethod({ assert }: Context) {
    Mock.when(this.object, 'hello').return('hello world')

    assert.equal(this.object.hello(), 'hello world')
  }
}
```

You can also use this method to throw an error when the
given method is called:

```typescript
@Test()
public async shouldBeAbleToMockAnObjectMethod({ assert }: Context) {
  Mock.when(this.object, 'hello').throw(new Error('hello world'))

  assert.throw(() => this.object.hello(), 'hello world')
}
```

For promises, you can use the `resolve()` or `reject()` methods:

```typescript
@Test()
public async shouldBeAbleToMockAnObjectMethod({ assert }: Context) {
  // Resolving a promise
  Mock.when(this.object, 'hello').resolve('hello world')
  assert.equal(await this.object.hello(), 'hello world')

  // Rejecting a promise
  Mock.when(this.object, 'hello').reject(new Error('hello world'))
  await assert.rejects(() => this.object.hello(), 'hello world')
}
```

If you don't have access to the method you want to mock, you can
save the return of `Mock::when()` method and use it to make your
assertions:

```typescript
@Test()
public async shouldBeAbleToMockAnObjectMethod({ assert }: Context) {
  const helloMock = Mock.when(this.object, 'hello').resolve('hello world')

  await this.someMethodThatCallsHelloMethod()

  assert.isTrue(helloMock.called)
}
```

#### Mocking a class method

There are two ways to mock a class method. The first one is
mocking the class instance directly:

```typescript
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Test, Mock, type Context, AfterEach } from '@athenna/test'

export default class MockTest {
  public appService = new AppService()

  @AfterEach()
  public afterEach() {
    Mock.restoreAll()
  }

  @Test()
  public async shouldBeAbleToMockAClassMethod({ assert }: Context) {
    Mock.when(this.appService, 'findOne').return({ fake: true })

    assert.equal(this.appService.findOne(), { fake: true })
  }
}
```

With this approach, you can only mock the method for the current
instance. If another instance of `AppService` is created, that
one will not be mocked.

To mock a class method for all instances of a given class, you
need to mock the class `prototype`:

```typescript
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Test, Mock, type Context, AfterEach } from '@athenna/test'

export default class MockTest {
  @AfterEach()
  public afterEach() {
    Mock.restoreAll()
  }

  @Test()
  public async shouldBeAbleToMockAClassMethod({ assert }: Context) {
    Mock.when(AppService.prototype, 'findOne').return({ fake: true })

    assert.equal(new AppService().findOne(), { fake: true })
  }
}
```

:::caution

Never forget to restore all mocks after each test case. If you don't
restore it, the mock will be kept in memory and will affect your other
tests. Test cases should be isolated from each other, so always try to
create your mocks inside your test cases to avoid problems when your
application gets bigger.

### The `Mock::spy()` method

This method is responsible for spying on a given object method.
Different from `Mock::when()`, this method will not change the
behavior of the method, it will only spy it and allow you to verify
if the given method was called, how many times, and with which params:

```typescript
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Test, Mock, type Context, AfterEach } from '@athenna/test'

export default class MockTest {
  @AfterEach()
  public afterEach() {
    Mock.restoreAll()
  }

  @Test()
  public async shouldBeAbleToSpyAClassMethod({ assert }: Context) {
    Mock.spy(AppService.prototype, 'findOne')

    const appService = new AppService()

    appService.findOne()

    assert.calledOnce(appService.findOne)
  }
}
```

Just like `Mock::when()`, if you don't have access to the method
you want to spy, you can save the return of `Mock::spy()` method
and use it to make your assertions:

```typescript
@Test()
public async shouldBeAbleToSpyAClassMethod({ assert }: Context) {
  const findOneSpy = Mock.spy(AppService.prototype, 'findOne')

  await this.someMethodThatCallsAppServiceFindOne()

  assert.calledOnce(findOneSpy)
}
```

:::tip

For more assertions like `assert.calledOnce()` method, check the
[assertion in mocks](/docs/testing/mocking#assertion-in-mocks)
documentation section.

:::

Since `Mock::spy()` does not change the behavior of the method,
but only spies it, you can use it to spy all the methods of a
given object:

```typescript
@Test()
public async shouldBeAbleToSpyAnEntireClass({ assert }: Context) {
  Mock.spy(AppService.prototype)

  const appService = new AppService()

  appService.findOne()

  assert.calledOnce(appService.findOne)
}
```

### The `Mock::fake()` method

This method is responsible for creating a fake object that
you can in parallel with `Mock::when()` method:

```typescript
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Test, Mock, type Context, AfterEach } from '@athenna/test'

export default class MockTest {
  @AfterEach()
  public afterEach() {
    Mock.restoreAll()
  }

  @Test()
  public async shouldBeAbleToMockTheReturnOfAClassMethod({ assert }: Context) {
    Mock.when(AppService.prototype, 'findOne').return({
      hello: Mock.fake()
    })

    const appService = new AppService()

    const result = appService.findOne()

    result.hello()

    assert.calledOnce(result.hello)
    assert.calledOnce(appService.findOne)
  }
}
```

## Mocking services

Mocking a single service method could be a difficult thing to do
if your service is not going to be registered as a singleton in your
application. The best way to mock a service is by instantiating
a new instance of the service, registering it in the container
and then mocking the method you want in each test case:

```typescript
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { BaseHttpTest } from '@athenna/core/testing/BaseHttpTest'
import { Test, type Context, BeforeAll, Mock, AfterEach } from '@athenna/test'

export default class AppControllerTest extends BaseHttpTest {
  public appService = new AppService()

  @BeforeAll()
  public async beforeAll() {
    ioc.instance('App/Services/AppService', this.appService)
  }

  @AfterEach()
  public async afterEach() {
    Mock.restoreAll()
  }

  @Test()
  public async shouldBeAbleToMock({ assert, request }: Context) {
    Mock.when(this.appService, 'findOne').return({ fake: true })

    const response = await request.get('/api/v1')

    response.assertStatusCode(200)
    response.assertBodyContains({ fake: true })
    assert.calledOnce(this.appService.findOne)
  }
}
```

### Replacing the entire service

If you prefer you can also replace the entire service with
a mocked version of your service using the `ioc.fake()` method

```typescript
import { Test, BeforeAll, type Context } from '@athenna/test'
import { AppServiceMock } from '#tests/fixtures/AppServiceMock'
import { BaseHttpTest } from '@athenna/core/testing/BaseHttpTest'

export default class AppControllerTest extends BaseHttpTest {
  @BeforeAll()
  public beforeAll() {
    ioc
      .fake('App/Services/AppService', AppServiceMock)
      .alias('appService', 'App/Services/AppService')
  }

  @Test()
  public async shouldBeAbleToMock({ request }: Context) {
    const response = await request.get('/api/v1')

    response.assertStatusCode(200)
    response.assertBodyContains({ fake: true })
  }
}
```
