# Publishing

Check how you can publish a global CLI application.

## Introduction

In this documentation section we are going to cover how
you can publish a global CLI application in NPM registry.

## Logging in to NPM

To publish your package on the NPM registry, you need to 
have an account at NPM. If you don't have an account, 
visit the [NPM sign up page](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) 
to create one.

After creating the account, open your terminal and run the 
following command in the root of your package:

```shell
npm login
```

You will get a prompt to enter your `username` and `password`. 
If login is successful, you should see a message like this:

```shell
Logged in as <your-username-here> on https://registry.npmjs.org/.
```

## Publishing

Now that you are authenticated, to publish a package to NPM
is very simple, just run the following command:

```shell
npm publish --access public
```

If you have been following along, then congratulations! You 
just published your first NPM package.

You can visit the NPM website and run a search for your 
package. You should see your package show up in the search results.
