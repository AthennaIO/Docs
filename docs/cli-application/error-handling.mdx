# Error Handling

Understand how you can handle the errors of the CLI Application.

## Introduction

When you start a new Athenna project, error and exception
handling is already configured for you. But you can configure
your own extending the Athenna error handler. We'll dive
deeper into how to do that throughout this documentation.

When you start a new Athenna project, error and exception
handling is already configured for you. But you can configure
your own extending the Athenna error handler. We'll dive deeper 
into how to do that throughout this documentation.

This documentation will cover about error handling in the **CLI**
application, which means that only errors that happens inside 
the `handle()` method of commands and bellow that will be handled:

```typescript title="app/console/commands/AppCommand.ts"
import { BaseCommand } from '@athenna/artisan'
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'

export class AppCommand extends BaseCommand {
  public static signature(): string {
    return 'app'
  }

  public static description(): string {
    throw new Error('This error will be handled by @athenna/core.') ðŸ‘ˆ

    return `Get some information's about the application.`
  }

  public async handle(): Promise<void> {
    const appService = ioc.safeUse<AppService>('App/Services/AppService')
    const json = JSON.stringify(appService.findOne(), null, 2)

    throw new Error('ConsoleExceptionHandler will handle this error.') ðŸ‘ˆ

    this.logger.info(`Application information's: ${json}`)
  }
}
```

:::info

Errors handled by `@athenna/core` usually means that a 
bootstrap failure has been found in your application.

:::

## Configuration

The `debug` option in your `Path.config('app.js')` configuration
file determines how much information about an error is
actually displayed to the user. By default, this option is
set to respect the value of the `APP_DEBUG` environment
variable, which is stored in your `.env` file.

During local development, you should set the `APP_DEBUG`
environment variable to `true`. In your production
environment, this value should always be `false`. If the
value is set to `true` in production, you risk exposing
sensitive configuration values to your application's end
users.

Every error will be logged by default using the `console`
driver from `@athenna/logger`. By default, Athenna uses the
`exception` channel of your `Path.config('logging.js')` file to log
all exceptions that happens in your application.

:::tip

You can change the driver and formatter of `exception`
channel inside `Path.config('logging.js')` file. This way you can
send all your error logs to another provider and with
a different formatter.

:::

## Custom exceptions

You can create custom exception by executing the following
Artisan command:

```shell
./node artisan make:exception BadCommandException
```

Next, import and raise the exception as follows.

```typescript
import { BadCommandException } from '#app/exceptions/BadCommandException'

throw new BadCommandException('Your command is bad.')
```

:::tip

Always try to use a custom exception to throw your errors
inside Athenna. If you use `Error`, `TypeError` and other
classes, it will not be treated by the handlers and will
always be considered as a not treated exception.

:::

## Simple exceptions

When talking about exceptions in Artisan and CLI applications,
we can divide them into two categories: simple exceptions and
the more complex ones. Simple exceptions are exceptions that
when handled by the `ConsoleExceptionHandler` will only log the
exception **message**. The more complex will log the entire exception
including **code, message, help and stack trace**.

Simple exceptions are recognized by `ConsoleExceptionHandler` by
the `code`. If the code is `E_SIMPLE_CLI`, it will be considered
as a simple exception:

```typescript title="app/console/exceptions/NotFoundDatabaseException.ts"
import { Exception } from '@athenna/common'

export class NotFoundDatabaseException extends Exception {
  public constructor(databaseName: string) {
    const code = 'E_SIMPLE_CLI' ðŸ‘ˆ

    super({ code, message: `Database ${databaseName} not found.` })
  }
}
```

## Implementing your own exception handler

Let's suppose you want to write a custom logic for handling
your exceptions. You can do so by creating your own
exception handler:

```typescript title="app/console/exceptions/Handler.ts"
import { ConsoleExceptionHandler } from '@athenna/artisan'

export class Handler extends ConsoleExceptionHandler {
  public async handle(error: any) {
      // Implement your own logic
  }
}
```

Now you need to register your exception handler when 
bootstrapping your application:

```typescript filename="Path.bootstrap('main.js')"
await ignite.artisan(process.argv, { 
  displayName: 'Athenna',
  exceptionHandlerPath: '#app/console/exceptions/Handler', ðŸ‘ˆ
})
```
