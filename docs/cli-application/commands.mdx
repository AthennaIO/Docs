# Commands

See how to create and configure your CLI commands.

## Introduction

In Athenna you are able to create your own CLI application
creating your own commands by extending the abstract class
`Command` and implement its methods.

## Writing commands

In addition to the commands provided with Artisan, you may
build your own custom commands. Commands are typically stored
in the `app/console/commands` directory; however, you are
free to choose your own storage location as long as your
commands can be imported.

### Generating commands

To create a new command, you may use the `make:command`
Artisan command. This command will create a new command
class in the `app/console/commands` directory and register
it inside `commands` object of `.athennarc.json` file.
Don't worry if this directory does not exist in your
applicationâ€”it will be created the first time you run the
`make:command` Artisan command:

```shell
./node artisan make:command SendEmails
```

### Commands structure

After generating your command, you should define
appropriate values for the `signature` and `description`
static properties of the class. These properties will be
used when displaying your command on the list screen. The
`handle` method will be called when your command is executed.
You may place your command logic in this method.

Athenna commands do not bootstrap the entire Athenna
application, meaning that all your services will not be
registered in the [service container](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container).
when running your commands. To do so, you need to set the
`"loadApp": true` in your command settings inside
`.athennarc.json` file. By default, Athenna commands
generated with `make:artisan` command, will
already define `"loadApp": true` for you:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "sendEmails": {
      "path": "#app/console/commands/SendEmails",
      "loadApp": true
    }
  }
}
```

Now we are able to request any dependencies we need using
the `@Inject()` annotation:

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { BaseCommand } from '@athenna/artisan'
import { MailgunService } from '#app/services/MailgunService'

export class SendEmails extends BaseCommand {
  public static signature(): string {
      return 'mail:send'
  }

  public static description(): string {
      return 'Send an email.'
  }

  @Inject()
  private mailgunService: MailgunService ðŸ‘ˆ

  public async handle(): Promise<void> {
    //
  }
}
```

:::warning

The application is bootstrapped only after your command is
already registered, meaning that you can't use the
automatic constructor injection with commands to resolve
your dependencies.

:::

:::tip

For greater code reuse, it is good practice keeping your
console commands light and let them defer to application
services to accomplish their tasks. In the example above,
note that we inject a service class to do the "heavy
lifting" of sending the e-mails.

### Defining input expectations

When writing console commands, it is common to gather
input from the user through arguments or options. Athenna
makes it very convenient to define the input you expect
from the user using the `@Argument()` and `@Option()`
annotations on your commands. See the example:

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { MailgunService } from '#app/services/MailgunService'
import { Option, Argument, BaseCommand } from '@athenna/artisan'

export class SendEmails extends BaseCommand {
  public static signature(): string {
      return 'mail:send'
  }

  public static description(): string {
      return 'Send an email.'
  }

  @Argument()
  private email: string

  @Option({
    signature: '-s, --subject <subject>',
    default: 'Athenna',
    description: 'Set the subject of the email.',
  })
  private subject: string

  @Inject()
  private mailgunService: MailgunService

  public async handle(): Promise<void> {
    const message = 'Hello from Athenna!'

    await this.mailgunService.send(this.email, {
      message,
      subject: this.subject,
    })
  }
}
```

## Registering commands

All of your console commands are registered within your
application's `.athennarc.json` file. If you have created
your command using `make:command` your command will already
be registered for you in `commands` object, but we still
recommend you to do some adjustments before using your
command.

In the example above we have changed the signature of
`SendEmails` command to `send:email`, we should always
use the command `signature` as key when registering our
commands in `commands` object:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "send:email": { ðŸ‘ˆ
      "path": "#app/console/commands/SendEmails",
      "loadApp": true
    }
  }
}
```

If you do so, Athenna will always import and load only that
specific command that you want to execute, meaning that if
you execute the following command:

```shell
./node artisan send:email lenon@athenna.io
```

Athenna will only import and load `SendEmails` class and
execute your command. If you change the key name to any
value different from the command `signature` (`send:email`)
Athenna will load all your commands defined in `commands`
object:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "sendEmails": { ðŸ‘ˆ // All commands will be loaded
      "path": "#app/console/commands/SendEmails",
      "loadApp": true
    }
  }
}
```

Loading all commands might be useful sometimes when your
command wants to [execute other commands in runtime](#calling-commands-in-runtime)
inside your command:

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { MailgunService } from '#app/services/MailgunService'
import { Option, Artisan, Argument, BaseCommand } from '@athenna/artisan'

export class SendEmails extends BaseCommand {
  public static signature(): string {
      return 'mail:send'
  }

  public static description(): string {
      return 'Send an email.'
  }

  @Argument()
  private email: string

  @Option({
    signature: '-s, --subject <subject>',
    default: 'Athenna',
    description: 'Set the subject of the email.',
  })
  private subject: string

  @Inject()
  private mailgunService: MailgunService

  public async handle(): Promise<void> {
    const message = 'Hello from Athenna!'

    await this.mailgunService.send(this.email, {
      message,
      subject: this.subject,
    })

    await Artisan.call(`save:email ${this.email}`)
  }
}
```

:::tip

Even for this purpose, we recommend you to let the key
of your command the same of your command `signature`.
To load all your commands, use the `loadAllCommands`
setting in your command:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "send:email": {
      "path": "#app/console/commands/SendEmails",
      "loadApp": true,
      "loadAllCommands": true ðŸ‘ˆ // All commands will be loaded
    }
  }
}
```

:::

## Calling commands in runtime

Sometimes you may wish to call other commands from an
existing Artisan command or from any other part of your
application. You may do so using the `call()` method from
Artisan. This method accepts the command string with its
arguments and options:

```typescript
import { Artisan } from '@athenna/artisan'

await Artisan.call('make:controller TestController')
```

If you want to verify if your command has generated some
output in `stdout` or `stderr` you can use the
`callInChild()` method:

```typescript
const { stdout, stderr } = await Artisan.callInChild('make:controller TestController')

assert.isTrue(stdout.includes('[ MAKING CONTROLLER ]'))
assert.isUndefined(stderr)
```
