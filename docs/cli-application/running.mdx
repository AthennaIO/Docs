# Running

Check how to run your CLI commands in different scenarios.

## Introduction

To run the CLI application you have two options:

1. Run using the `node artisan`.
2. Link your CLI using `npm link` command and run it anywhere.

As running with `node artisan` is simple and has a lot of examples
over Athenna documentation, we are going to focus in linking your
CLI to run anywhere of your terminal.

## Registering your CLI command name

To register your CLI command name, you need to add the
`bin` object inside your `package.json` file and set the
path to the entry point file of your CLI:

```json
"bin": {
  "yourCliCommand": "./bin/main.js"
}
```

## Entrypoint file

In our example we defined the `./bin/main.js` 
file as the entrypoint file of our CLI. By default, this 
file comes with the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env node`
in the top of the file. Without this line the `npm link` 
command will not work. So just in case you want to define a 
different entrypoint file, remember that `#!/usr/bin/env node`
should be on the top of this file.

## Linking the CLI

Now you need to run the following command in your project root:

```bash
npm link
```

And now the `yourCliCommand` will exist in your actual Node.js version:

```bash
yourCliCommand --help
```

## Display CLI name

When running your CLI without any option and command, the display
name will be rendered in the terminal using 
[chalk-rainbow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk-rainbow) 
and [figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet).

By default, Artisan always display the `Artisan` name, but you can
change it for your own display name by setting the `displayName` 
property in `Ignite.console()` method:

```typescript title="Path.bin('main.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url)

await ignite.console(process.argv, {
  displayName: 'Your CLI Command', ðŸ‘ˆ
})
```

:::tip

If you wish to disable the display name, set the `displayName`
as `null`:

```typescript title="Path.bin('main.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url)

await ignite.console(process.argv, {
  displayName: null, ðŸ‘ˆ
})
```
