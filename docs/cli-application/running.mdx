# Running

Check how to run your CLI commands in different scenarios.

## Introduction

The CLI application of Athenna can run in three ways. 
Using the `./node artisan`, the npm scripts inside 
`package.json` file or linking the CLI using `npm link`, 
this way you can execute your CLI anywhere from your 
terminal. As Artisan and npm scripts comes configured by 
default in your application, we are going to focus in 
`npm link` in this documentation.

## Registering your CLI command name

To register your CLI command name you need to add the 
`bin` object inside your `package.json` file and set the
path to the entry point file of your CLI:

```json
"bin": {
  "yourCliCommand": "./bootstrap/main.js"
}
```

## Entrypoint file

In our example we defined the `./bootstrap/main.js` 
file as the entrypoint file of our CLI. By default, this 
file comes with the shebang line 
`#!/usr/bin/env -S node --experimental-import-meta-resolve` 
in the top of the file. Without this line the `npm link` 
command will not work. So just in case you want to define a 
different entrypoint file, remember that 
`#!/usr/bin/env -S node --experimental-import-meta-resolve` 
should be on the top of this file.

## Linking the CLI

Now you just need to run the following command in your project root:

```shell
npm link
```

And now the `yourCliCommand` will exist in your actual Node.js version:

```shell
yourCliCommand --help
```

## Display CLI name

When running your CLI without any option and command, the display
name will be rendered in the terminal using 
[`chalk-rainbow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk-rainbow) 
and [`figlet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet).

By default Artisan always display the `Artisan` name, but you can
change it for your own display name by setting the `displayName` 
property in `Ignite.artisan()` method:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('main.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url)

await ignite.artisan({
  displayName: 'Your CLI Command', ðŸ‘ˆ
})
```

:::tip

If you wish to disable the display name, just set the `displayName`
as `null`:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('main.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url)

await ignite.artisan({
  displayName: null, ðŸ‘ˆ
})
```
