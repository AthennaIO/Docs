# Facades

Understand the purpose and how to use the Athenna facades.

## Introduction

Throughout the Athenna documentation, you will see examples of code that
interacts with Athenna features via "facades". Facades provide a "static"
interface to class that are available in the application's [service container](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container).
Athenna ships with many facades which provide access to almost all the Athenna
features.

Athenna facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service
container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining
more testability and flexibility than traditional static methods. It's perfectly
fine if you don't totally understand how facades work under the hood‚Äîjust go
with the flow and continue learning about Athenna.

All Athenna facades are defined in their own packages. So, we can easily access
a facade like so:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger' // Log Facade
import { Route } from '@athenna/http' // Route Facade

Route.get('/welcome', ({ response }) => {
  Log.channel('simple').success('New request received üòù')

  return response.status(200).send({ message: 'ok' })
})
```

Throughout the Athenna documentation, many of the examples will use facades to
demonstrate various features of the framework.

## Helpers

To complement facades, Athenna offers a variety of "helper classes" that make it
even easier to interact with common Athenna features. Some common helper
functions you may interact with are `Env`, `Config`, `Path`, and more. Each helper
function offered by Athenna is documented with their corresponding feature;
however, a complete list is available within [the dedicated helpers' documentation](/docs/digging-deeper/helpers).

## When to use facades

Facades have many benefits. They provide a terse, memorable syntax that allows
you to use Athenna features without remembering long class names that must be
injected or configured manually.

However, some care must be taken when using facades. The primary danger of
facades is class "scope creep". Since facades are so easy to use and do not
require injection, it can be easy to let your classes continue to grow and use
many facades in a single class. Using dependency injection, this potential is
mitigated by the visual feedback a large constructor gives you that your class
is growing too large. So, when using facades, pay special attention to the size
of your class so that its scope of responsibility stays narrow. If your class
is getting too large, consider splitting it into multiple smaller classes.

## How facades work

In an Athenna application, a facade is a class that provides access to an
object from the container. The machinery that makes this work is in the `Facade`
class. Athenna facades, and any custom facades you create, will be created
using the `Facade` class.

The `Facade` class makes use of the [Proxy API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
to defer calls from your facade to an object resolved from the container. In the
example below, a call is made to the Athenna log system. By glancing at this
code, one might assume that the static `success()` method is being called on the
`Log` class:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger'
import { Context, Controller } from '@athenna/http'

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  public async show({ response }: Context) {
    Log.success('Welcome to Athenna üòù')

    return response.status(200).send({ hello: 'world' })
  }
}
```

Notice that near the top of the file we are importing the `Log` facade. This
facade serves as a proxy for accessing the underlying implementation of the
`Logger` class from Athenna service container. Any calls we make using the
facade will be passed to the underlying instance of Athenna logger class.

If we look at the Log facade file implementation, you'll see that `Log` is
just a constant that points to the alias `Athenna/Core/Logger` that is
registered inside the service container:

```typescript
import { Facade } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { Logger } from '#src/logger/Logger'

export const Log = Facade.createFor<Logger>('Athenna/Core/Logger')
```

The job of the `createFor()` method is to create a new proxy object that will
have the same methods as the `Logger` class. So, when the user references any
static method on the `Log` facade, Athenna will first resolve the
`Athenna/Core/Logger` binding from the [service container](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container)
and them runs the requested method, (in the example above, the `success()`
method) against that object.

## Facades class reference

Below you will find every facade and its underlying class. This is a useful
tool for quickly digging into the API documentation for a given facade root.
The service container binding key is also included where applicable.

## Writing facades

First, let's use the following command to create a new [service provider](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-providers)
to resolve our dependency inside the [service container](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container):

```shell
./node artisan make:provider HelperProvider
```

Now let's register all of our helpers inside the `register()` method:

```typescript
import { File } from '#app/helpers/File'
import { String } from '#app/helpers/String'
import { ServiceProvider } from '@athenna/ioc'

export class HelperProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  public register() {
    this.container.singleton('App/Helpers/File', File)
    this.container.transient('App/Helpers/String', String)
  }
}
```

:::warning

If you have not used `make:provider` command to create the provider, you
will need to register it inside the `.athennarc.json` file, inside the
`providers` array.

:::

Artisan can generate a new facade via the `make:facade` command:

```shell
./node artisan make:facade String
```

The facade file will be generated inside the `providers/facades` directory.
Open this file and change the alias to your provider alias and set up the
generic type:

```typescript
import { Facade } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { String as StringImpl } from '#app/helpers/String'

export const String = Facade.createFor<StringImpl>('App/Helpers/String')
```

Now we can start using our new `String` facade:

```typescript
import { Route } from '@athenna/http' // Route Facade
import { String } from '#providers/facades/String' // String Facade

Route.get('/welcome', ({ response }) => {
  return response
    .status(200)
    .send({ hello: String.toPascalCase('world') })
})
```
