## Introduction {#id-introduction}

Throughout the Athenna documentation, you will see examples of code that interacts with Athenna features via "facades".
Facades provide a "static" interface to class that are available in the application's [`service container`](/docs/architecture-concepts/container).
Athenna ships with many facades which provide access to almost all of Athenna features.

Athenna facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse,
expressive syntax while maintaining more testability and flexibility than traditional static methods. It's perfectly fine
if you don't totally understand how facades work under the hood - just go with the flow and continue learning about Athenna.

All of Athenna facades are defined in their own packages. So, we can easily access a facade like so:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger' // Log Facade
import { Route } from '@athenna/http' // Route Facade

Route.get('/welcome', function ({ response }) {
    Log.success('New request received üòù')

    return response.status(200).send({ hello: 'world' })
});
```

Throughout the Athenna documentation, many of the examples will use facades to demonstrate various features of the framework.

### Helper functions

To complement facades, Athenna offers a variety of global "helper functions" that make it even easier to interact with
common Athenna features. Some common helper functions you may interact with are `Env`, `Config`, `Path`, and more. Each
helper function offered by Athenna is documented with their corresponding feature; however, a complete list is available
within the dedicated [helper documentation](/docs/getting-started/helpers).
