## Introduction {#id-introduction}

Throughout the Athenna documentation, you will see examples of code that interacts with Athenna features via "facades".
Facades provide a "static" interface to class that are available in the application's [`service container`](/docs/architecture-concepts/container).
Athenna ships with many facades which provide access to almost all of Athenna features.

Athenna facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse,
expressive syntax while maintaining more testability and flexibility than traditional static methods. It's perfectly fine
if you don't totally understand how facades work under the hood - just go with the flow and continue learning about Athenna.

All of Athenna facades are defined in their own packages. So, we can easily access a facade like so:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger' // Log Facade
import { Route } from '@athenna/http' // Route Facade

Route.get('/welcome', function ({ response }) {
    Log.channel('simple').success('New request received üòù')

    return response.status(200).send({ hello: 'world' })
});
```

Throughout the Athenna documentation, many of the examples will use facades to demonstrate various features of the framework.

### Helper functions

To complement facades, Athenna offers a variety of global "helper functions" that make it even easier to interact with
common Athenna features. Some common helper functions you may interact with are `Env`, `Config`, `Path`, and more. Each
helper function offered by Athenna is documented with their corresponding feature; however, a complete list is available
within the dedicated [`helper documentation`](/docs/getting-started/installation).

## When to use facades {#id-when-to-use-facades}

Facades have many benefits. They provide a terse, memorable syntax that allows you to use Athenna features without
remembering long class names that must be injected or configured manually.

However, some care must be taken when using facades. The primary danger of facades is class "scope creep". Since facades
are so easy to use and do not require injection, it can be easy to let your classes continue to grow and use many facades
in a single class. Using dependency injection, this potential is mitigated by the visual feedback a large constructor
gives you that your class is growing too large. So, when using facades, pay special attention to the size of your class
so that its scope of responsibility stays narrow. If your class is getting too large, consider splitting it into multiple
smaller classes.

## How facades work {#id-how-facades-work}

In a Athenna application, a facade is a class that provides access to an object from the container. The machinery that
makes this work is in the `Facade` class. Athenna facades, and any custom facades you create, will extend the base
`Facade` class.

The `Facade` base class makes use of the `Proxy API` to defer calls from your facade to an object resolved from the
container. In the example below, a call is made to the Athenna log system. By glancing at this code, one might assume
that the static `success` method is being called on the `Log` class:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger'
import { ContextContract } from '@athenna/http'

export class WelcomeController {
  /**
   * Show the welcome payload.
   *
   * @param ctx
   * @return any
   */
  async show({ response }: ContextContract) {
    Log.success('Welcome to Athenna üòù')

    return response.status(200).send({ hello: 'world' })
  }
}
```

Notice that near the top of the file we are importing the `Log` facade. This facade serves as a proxy for accessing the
underlying implementation of the `Logger` class from Athenna service container. Any calls we make using the facade will
be passed to the underlying instance of Athenna logger class.

If we look at that `Log`, you'll see that `Log` is just a constant that points to the alias `Athenna/Core/Logger` that is
registered inside the service container:

```typescript
import { Logger } from 'src/Logger'
import { Facade } from '@athenna/ioc'

export const Log = Facade.createFor<Logger>('Athenna/Core/Logger')
```

This method's job is to return the name of a service container binding. When a user references any static method on the
`Log` facade, Athenna resolves the `Athenna/Core/Logger` binding from the [`service container`](/docs/architecture-concepts/container)
and runs the requested method (in this case, `success`) against that object.

## Facade class reference {#id-facade-class-reference}

Below you will find every facade and its underlying class. This is a useful tool for quickly digging into the API
documentation for a given facade root. The service container binding key is also included where applicable.

## Writing facades {#id-writing-facades}

First you need to create a new [`service provider`](/docs/architecture-concepts/providers#id-writing-service-providers)
to resolve your dependency inside the [`service container`](/docs/architecture-concepts/container). Just run `athenna make:provider HelperProvider`
and `providers/HelperProvider` and register your binding:

```typescript
import { String } from 'app/Helpers/String'
import { ServiceProvider } from '@athenna/ioc'

export class HelperProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  /**
   * Register any application services.
   *
   * @return void
   */
  register() {}

  /**
   * Bootstrap any application services.
   *
   * @return void
   */
  boot() {
    this.container.bind('App/Helpers/String', String)
  }
}
```

:::caution

If you have not used `athenna make:provider` command, you will need to register your `HelperProvider` inside `config/app`
file inside the `providers` array.

:::

The Athenna CLI can generate a new Facade via the `make:facade` command:

```shell
athenna make:facade String
```

The Facade file will be generated inside `providers/Facades` folder. Open this file and change the alias to your
provider alias:

```typescript
import { Facade } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { String } from 'app/Helpers/String'

export const String = Facade.createFor<String>('App/Helpers/String')
```

Now we can start using our brand new `String` facade:

```typescript
import { Route } from '@athenna/http' // Route Facade
import { String } from 'providers/Facades/String' // String Facade

Route.get('/welcome', function ({ response }) {
    return response.status(200).send({ hello: String.toPascalCase('world') })
});
```
