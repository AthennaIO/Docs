# Service Container

Understand the purpose and how to use the Athenna service container.

## Introduction

The Athenna service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies
and performing dependency injection. Dependency injection is a fancy phrase that
essentially means this: class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the
constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.

Let's look at a simple example:

```typescript
import { Controller, type Context } from '@athenna/http'
import { WelcomeService } from '#app/services/WelcomeService'

@Controller()
export class WelcomeController {
  private welcomeService: WelcomeService

  public constructor(welcomeService) {
    this.welcomeService = welcomeService
  }

  public async show({ response }: Context) {
    const data = await this.welcomeService.getWelcomeData()

    return response.status(200).send(data)
  }
}
```

In this example, the `WelcomeController` needs to retrieve the welcome payload
from a data source. So, we will inject a service that is able to retrieve the
payload. In this context, our `WelcomeService`. Since the `WelcomeService` is
injected, we are able to easily swap it out with another implementation. We are
also able to easily 'mock', or create a dummy implementation of the
`WelcomeService` when testing our application.

A deep understanding of the Athenna service container is essential to building a
powerful, large application, as well as for contributing to the Athenna core
itself.

## Simple resolution

If you use the `@Service` annotation, you can instruct the container how he
should resolve that class, or use the default resolution configurations of the
annotation. For example, you may place the following code in your
`Path.routes('http.ts')` file:

```typescript
import { Route } from '@athenna/http'
import { Service } from '@athenna/ioc'

@Service()
export class AppService {
  public ok() {
    return { message: 'ok' }
  }
}

Route.get('/', ({ response }) => {
  const appService = ioc.use<AppService>('appService')
  const body = appService.ok()

  return response.status(200).send(body)
})
```

In this example, when bootstrapping your application, Athenna will bind the
`AppService` class inside the container. When hitting your application's / route,
it will be resolved by using the `ioc` global variable. This is game changing. It
means you can develop your application and take advantage of dependency
injection without worrying about bloated configuration files.

Thankfully, many of the classes you will be writing when building an Athenna
application automatically receive their dependencies via the container,
including [controllers](/docs/rest-api-application/controllers) and
[middlewares](/docs/rest-api-application/middlewares). Once you taste the power of
automatic and zero configuration dependency injection, it feels impossible to
develop without it.

:::important

The example above is just to show that we can place our services anywhere in our
application, without depending on configuration files or any other kind of
setup. We recommend you placing your services in a specifics directory to save
only your service classes and not inside your route file. A good place to put
your services is `app/services` directory, since `make:service` command will
save your services there. But of course you can do whatever you want with
Athenna ðŸ˜Ž.

## When to use the container

Thanks to this simple configuration resolution, you will often just import your
dependency on your routes, controllers, and elsewhere without ever manually
interacting with the container. For example, you might just import your
`AppService` in your controller so that you can easily access the business
logic wrote in the service class. Even though we never have to interact with
the container to write this code, it is managing the injection of their
dependencies behind the scenes.

```typescript
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Controller, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  public constructor(private appService: AppService) {}

  public async show({ response }: Context) {
    const data = await this.appService.getDate()

    return response.status(200).send(data)
  }
}
```

In many cases, thanks to automatic dependency injection and
[facades](/docs/architecture-concepts/facades), you can build Athenna applications
without ever manually binding or resolving anything from the container. **So,
when would you ever manually interact with the container?**

If you are writing an Athenna package that you plan to share with other Athenna
developers, you may need to bind your package's services into the container.

## Binding

Almost all of your service container bindings will be registered within
service providers, so most of these examples will demonstrate using the
container in that context.

In your application you will always have access to the container via the `ioc`
global property. We can register a binding using the `bind` method, passing the
alias name that we wish to register along with our dependency:

```typescript
import { StringNormalizer } from '#app/helpers/StringNormalizer'

ioc.bind('App/Helpers/StringNormalizer', StringNormalizer)
```

### Binding transients

The `transient` method binds a class into the container that will resolve
different instances of it each time. Meaning that once a transient binding is
resolved, a new object instance will be returned on subsequent calls into the
container:

```typescript
import { StringNormalizer } from '#app/helpers/StringNormalizer'

ioc.transient('App/Helpers/StringNormalizer', StringNormalizer)
```

:::note

By default, the `bind` method will always register your dependencies as
`transient`.

:::

### Binding a singleton

The `singleton` method binds a class into the container that should only be
resolved one time. Once a singleton binding is resolved, the same object
instance will be returned on subsequent calls into the container:

```typescript
import { StringNormalizer } from '#app/helpers/StringNormalizer'

ioc.singleton('App/Helpers/StringNormalizer', StringNormalizer)
```

### Binding instances

You may also bind an existing object instance into the container using the
`instance` method. The given instance will always be returned on subsequent
calls into the container:

```typescript
import { StringNormalizer } from '#app/helpers/StringNormalizer'

ioc.instance('App/Helpers/StringNormalizer', new StringNormalizer())
```

## Resolving

You may use the `use` or `safeUse` methods from the ioc global property to
resolve a class instance from the container. The use method accepts the alias
of the dependency you wish to resolve:

```typescript
import { StringNormalizer } from '#app/helpers/StringNormalizer'

const sn = ioc.use<StringNormalizer>('App/Helpers/StringNormalizer')
```

If the dependency alias cannot be found in the container, `sn` const will be
set as `undefined`. To throw errors when the dependency does not exist, use
the `safeUse` method.

### Automatic constructor injection

Alternatively, and importantly, you can use the constructor of a class that is
resolved by the container, including
[controllers](/docs/rest-api-application/controllers), [middlewares](/docs/rest-api-application/middlewares),
and more.

For example, you may add your provider name in camelCase in the controller's
constructor. The service will automatically be resolved and injected into the
class:

```typescript
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Controller, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  public constructor(private appService: AppService) {}

  public async show({ response }: Context) {
    const data = await this.appService.getData()

    return response.status(200).send(data)
  }
}
```

### Using `@Inject` annotation

You can also use the `@Inject` annotation instead of the constructor. The
annotation follows the same logic of the constructor, you need to use the
camelCase name of your dependency as the property name to be resolved properly:

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Controller, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Inject()
  private appService: AppService

  public async show({ response }: Context) {
    const data = await this.appService.getData()

    return response.status(200).send(data)
  }
}
```

When using the `@Inject` annotation you could also passes as argument a
specific alias to be resolved in the container:

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { AppService } from '#app/services/AppService'
import { Controller, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Inject('App/Services/AppService')
  private appService: AppService

  public async show({ response }: Context) {
    const data = await this.appService.getData()

    return response.status(200).send(data)
  }
}
```
