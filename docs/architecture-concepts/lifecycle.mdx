## Introduction {#id-introduction}

When using any tool in the "real world", you feel more confident if you understand how that tool works. Application
development is no different. When you understand how your development tools function, you feel more comfortable and
confident using them.

The goal of this document is to give you a good, high-level overview of how the Athenna framework works. By getting to
know the overall framework better, everything feels less "magical" and you will be more confident building your
applications. If you don't understand all the terms right away, don't lose heart! Just try to get a basic grasp of what
is going on, and your knowledge will grow as you explore other sections of the documentation.

## Lifecycle overview {#id-lifecycle-overview}

### First steps {#id-first-steps}

The entry point for all types of an Athenna application is the `bootstrap/main` file. The first action taken by Athenna
itself is to create an instance of the container and then of the application.

### Service providers {#id-service-providers}

One of the most important kernel bootstrapping actions is loading the service providers for your application. All the
service providers for the application are configured in the `config/app` configuration file's providers array.

Athenna will iterate through this list of providers and instantiate each of them. After instantiating the providers,
the `register` method will be called on all the providers. Then, once all the providers have been registered, the
`boot` method will be called on each provider. This is so service providers may depend on every container binding being
registered and available by the time their boot method is executed.

Service providers are responsible for bootstrapping all the framework's various components, such as the database, http server,
validation, services and routing components. Essentially every major feature offered by Athenna is bootstrapped and
configured by a service provider. Since they bootstrap and configure so many features offered by the framework, service
providers are the most important aspect of the entire Athenna bootstrap process.

### Routes {#id-routes}

The `routes` folder is the kernel of your application. The route files that you will find here are:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="http" label="http" default>

This file is responsible to create a contract between your client and your application. Is
in here that we define all of ours routes and the controllers who will handle the client request.

One of the most important service providers in your application is the `HttpRouteProvider`. This service provider adds in
the container the `Route` class instance used inside `http` file. This service provider also adds `routes/http` as a `preload`
file of the application.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Finishing up {#id-finishing-up}

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="http" label="http" default>

Once the route or controller method returns a response, the response will travel back outward through the route's
middleware, giving the application a chance to modify or examine the outgoing response.

Finally, once the response travels back through the middleware we send the response content to the client. We've finished
our journey through the entire Athenna request lifecycle!

</Tabs>

## Focus on service providers {#id-focus-on-service-providers}

Service providers are truly the key to bootstrapping an Athenna application. The application instance is created, the
service providers are registered, and the request is handed to the bootstrapped application. It's really that simple!

Having a firm grasp of how an Athenna application is built and bootstrapped via service providers is very valuable.
Your application's default service providers are stored in the `providers` directory.

By default, the `CustomProvider` is fairly empty. This provider is a great place to add your application's own
bootstrapping and service container bindings. For large applications, you may wish to create several service providers,
each with more granular bootstrapping for specific services used by your application.
