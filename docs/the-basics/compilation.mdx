# Compilation

Understand the TypeScript compilation process of Athenna.

## Introduction

One of the main objectives of the framework is to offer 
exceptional assistance for TypeScript. This extends beyond 
the benefits of static types and IntelliSense that enhance 
your coding experience. Furthermore, we make certain that 
there is no need for you to install extra build utilities 
for code compilation, both during the development phase and 
for production purposes.

:::warning

This documentation assumes that you have a basic knowledge 
about TypeScript and the build tools available for it.

:::

## Compiling for development

In the root path of your project you already have a 
shell script file called `node`, This file is useful 
for development purposes because it allows you to run 
TypeScript files without having to add the 
`--loader=ts-node/esm` option every time:

```shell
./node index.ts
```

This file works exactly like the `node` command, you
can set all node flags before the path to the file you
want to execute:

```shell
./node --watch index.ts
```

:::tip

You can learn more about the `node` file in the 
[node script file documentation section](/docs/getting-started/node-sript-file). 

:::

## Compiling for production

When you are ready to deploy your application to 
production, you can use the following command: 

```shell
./node artisan build
```

It performs the following operations:

- Clean the existing build directory (if any).
- Type check and compile the code using `tsc`. The tsconfig
file path that will be used is defined inside the 
`.athennarc.json` file under the `build.tsconfig` property.
- Copy all the static files to the build folder. The 
static files are registered inside the `.athennarc.json` 
file under the `build.metaFiles` array.

### Points to keep in mind

After building your code, the output folder becomes 
the root of your JavaScript application, this means two things:

1. You must `cd` into the build folder and install production
only dependencies:

```shell
cd build
npm ci --production
```

2. You must always `cd` into the build folder and then 
run your app:

```shell
cd build
node --experimental-import-meta-resolve bootstrap/main.js
```

:::warning

We do not copy the `.env` file to the output folder 
(even if you add it to `build.metaFiles` array) to prevent
issues for you. The environment variables are not transferable,
you must define environment variables for production separately.
