# Compilation

Understand the TypeScript compilation process of Athenna.

## Introduction

One of the main objectives of the framework is to offer 
exceptional assistance for TypeScript. This extends beyond 
the benefits of static types and IntelliSense that enhance 
your coding experience. Furthermore, we make certain that 
there is no need for you to install extra build utilities 
for code compilation, both during the development phase and 
for production purposes.

:::warning

This documentation assumes that you have basic knowledge
about TypeScript and the build tools available for it.

:::

## Compiling for development

If you are using `artisan` to run your application,
it will already compile the code for you in run time,
thanks to the `ts-node/esm` loader.

However, you may want to run a different TypeScript
file using `node`.

For Node.js v20.x or higher:

```bash
node --import=@athenna/tsconfig index.ts
```

For Node.js v19.x or lower:

```bash
node --loader=ts-node/esm index.ts
```

## Compiling for production

When you are ready to deploy your application to 
production, you can use the following command: 

```bash
node artisan build
```

It performs the following operations:

- Clean the existing build directory (if any). The build
directory that will he cleaned is defined inside the `.athennarc.json`
file under the `commands.build.outDir` property.
- Type check and compile the code using `tsc`. The tsconfig
file path that will be used is defined inside the 
`.athennarc.json` file under the `commands.build.tsconfig` 
property.
- Copy all the static files to the build folder. The 
static files are registered inside the `.athennarc.json` 
file under the `commands.build.include` array. This property
needs to always be used to copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### Points to keep in mind

After building your code, the output folder becomes 
the root of your JavaScript application, this means two things:

1. You must `cd` into the build folder and install production
only dependencies:

```bash
cd build
npm ci --omit=dev
```

2. You must always `cd` into the build folder and then 
run your app:

```bash
cd build
node bootstrap/main.js
```

:::warning

We do not copy the `.env` file to the output folder 
(even if you add it to `commands.build.include` array) to
prevent issues for you. The environment variables are not 
transferable, you must define environment variables for 
production separately.
