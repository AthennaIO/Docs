# Logging

Understand how you can use the Athenna logging API.

## Introduction

To help you learn more about what's happening within your
application, Athenna provides robust logging services that
allow you to log messages to file, console, buckets and even
to Slack to notify your entire team.

Athenna logging is based on "channels". Each channel represents
a specific way of writing log information. For example,
the `application` channel writes log of your application when
bootstrapping, while the `request` channel writes log of
the http requests that your application receives.

## Configuration

All the configuration options for your application's logging
behavior are housed in the `config/logging.ts` configuration
file. This file allows you to configure your application's
log channels, so be sure to review each of the available
channels and their options. We'll review a few common options
below.

## Available channel drivers

Each log channel is powered by a "driver". The driver determines
how and where the log message is actually transported. The
following log channel drivers are available in every Athenna
application. An entry for most of these drivers is already
present in your application's `config/logging.ts` configuration
file, so be sure to review this file to become familiar with
its contents:

| Driver name |                                                      Description |
|:------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `stack`     |        A wrapper to facilitate creating "multi-channel" channels |
| `console`   | Transports the log directly to the terminal with `stdout/stderr` |
| `file`      |                                     Transports the log to a file |
| `null`      |                                        Discards all log messages |
| `slack`     |                    Transports the log message to a Slack channel |
| `discord`   |                  Transports the log message to a Discord channel |
| `telegram`  |                    Transports the log message to a Telegram chat |

### Channel prerequisites

Almost all channels doesn't need any additional configuration to
work. But some of than need a couple of changes in
`config/logging.ts` file to be able to use. They are `slack`,
`discord` and `telegram`.

#### Configuring the Slack channel

The `slack` channel only requires the `url` property inside
options. This URL should match a URL for an [`incoming webhook`](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
that you have configured for your Slack team.

```typescript
slack: {
  driver: 'slack',
  level: 'fatal',
  url: 'your-slack-webhook-url', ðŸ‘ˆ

  formatter: 'message',
  formatterConfig: {}
}
```

#### Configuring the Discord channel

The `discord` channel requires the `url` and `username`
properties inside options. The URL should match a URL for an
[`incoming webhook`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-discord-webhooks-to-get-notifications-for-your-website-status-on-ubuntu-18-04)
that you have configured for your Discord server. And the
username is just the name of the bot that will deliver the
message.

```typescript
discord: {
  driver: 'discord',
  level: 'fatal',
  username: 'Athenna', ðŸ‘ˆ
  url: 'your-discord-webhook-url', ðŸ‘ˆ

  formatter: 'message',
  formatterConfig: {}
}
```

#### Configuring the Telegram channel

The `telegram` channel requires the `token` and `chatId`
properties inside options. The token should match a
[`Telegram bot token`](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
that you have created talking with `Bot Father`. And the
chatId is just the id of the chat that the bot will deliver
the message.

```typescript
telegram: {
  driver: 'telegram',
  level: 'fatal',
  chatId: 0, ðŸ‘ˆ
  parseMode: 'HTML',
  token: 'your-telegram-bot-token', ðŸ‘ˆ

  formatter: 'message',
  formatterConfig: {}
}
```

### Implementing your own driver

You can implement your own `Log` driver using the
`DriverFactory` class, but your class needs to implement
the `transport` method and extends `Driver` class:

```typescript
import { Driver } from '@athenna/logger'

export class ConsoleLogDriver extends Driver {
  public transport(level: string, message: any) {
   /**
    * Verify if this log could be transported based on the level.
    */
    if (!this.couldBeTransported(level)) {
      return
    }

    let formatted = this.format(level, message)

    if (this.driverConfig.addBar) {
        formatted = formatted.concat('- BAR')
    }

    console.log(formatted)
  }
}
```

Now we just need to use the `DriverFactory` to register our new driver and set a name for him:

```typescript
import { DriverFactory } from '@athenna/logger'

DriverFactory.createDriver('consoleLog', ConsoleLogDriver)
```

Finally, we can start using our new driver in channels of `config/logging.js`:

```typescript
channels: {
    consoleLogChannel: {
        driver: 'consoleLog',
        addBar: true,

        formatter: 'simple'
    }
}
```

## Writing log messages

You may write information to the logs using the `Log`
[`facade`](/docs/architecture-concepts/facades). The logger
provides the seven logging levels:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger'

const message = 'Hello Athenna!'

Log.trace(message)
Log.debug(message)
Log.info(message)
Log.success(message)
Log.warn(message)
Log.error(message)
Log.fatal(message)
```

You may call any of these methods to log a message for the
corresponding level. By default, the message will be written
to the default log channel as configured by your
`config/logging.ts` configuration file:

```typescript
import { WelcomeService } from '#app/Services/WelcomeService'

export class WelcomeController {
  @Inject()
  private welcomeService: WelcomeService

  public async show({ request, response }) {
    const data = await this.welcomeService.findOne()

    Log.info(`Showing the welcome message for ip: ${request.ip}`)

    return response.status(200).send(data)
  }
}
```

### Writing to specific channels

Sometimes you may wish to log a message to a channel other
than your application's default channel. You may use the
`channel` method on the `Log` facade to retrieve and log to
any channel defined in your configuration file:

```typescript
Log.channel('slack').info('Hello from Athenna!')
```

### Building log stacks

As mentioned previously, the `stack` driver allows you to
combine multiple channels into a single log channel for
convenience.
To illustrate how to use log stacks, let's take a look at an
example configuration that you might see in a production
application:

Take note of the `level` configuration option present in
`slack` channel of your `config/logging.ts` file:

```typescript
channels: {
    stack: {
      driver: 'stack',
      channels: ['application', 'slack']
    },

    application: {
      driver: 'console',
      level: 'trace',

      formatter: 'simple'
    },

    slack: {
      driver: 'slack',
      level: 'error',
      url: 'your-slack-webhook-url',

      formatter: 'message'
    }
}
```

Let's dissect this configuration. First, notice our `stack`
channel aggregates two other channels via its channel option:
`application` and `slack`. So, when logging messages, both of
these channels will have the opportunity to log the message.
However, as we will see below, whether these channels
actually log the message may be determined by the message's
severity / "level".

#### Log levels {#id-log-levels}

Take note of the `level` configuration option present on the
`application` and `slack` channel configurations in the
example above.
This option determines the minimum "level" a message must be
in order to be logged by the channel. In descending order of
severity, these log levels are: **fatal, error, warn, success,
info, debug** and **trace**.

So, imagine we log a message using the `debug` method:

```typescript
Log.debug('An informational message.')
```

Given our configuration, the `application` channel will write
the message to the system log; however, since the error
message is
not `error` or above, it will not be sent to Slack. However,
if we log an `fatal` message, it will be sent to both the
system
log and Slack since the `fatal` level is above our minimum
level threshold for both channels:

```typescript
Log.fatal('The application is down!')
```

### Writing styled log messages

When using the `Log` facade you have the power to add style to
your log messages:

```typescript
Log.info('({yellow, bold} Hello) ({green, italic} World)!')
```

Athenna uses [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) API
under the hood to parse the methods inside the brackets
(`({...chalkMethods} yourLogString)`), the example above could
also be done using [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) directly:

```typescript
import chalk from 'chalk'

Log.info(`${chalk.yellow.bold('Hello')} ${chalk.green.italic('World')}!`)
```

### Runtime configurations

It is also possible to set runtime configurations when using the
`Log` facade. This way you will never be total dependent
from `config/logging.ts` configuration file. To accomplish this,
you may pass a configuration object to the `config` method
of Log facade and then call the `channel` method again to set
up the configurations for the specified driver:

```typescript
const config = { url: 'other-slack-webhook-url' }

// GOOD!! Configuration is now set for drivers.
Log.config(config).channel('slack').info('Hello from Athenna!')

// BAD!! Configuration is not going to be set for drivers.
Log.config(config).info('Hello from Athenna!')
```

## Available channel formatters

Each log channel is powered by a "formatter". The formatter
determines how the log message is actually formatted.
The following log channel formatters are available in every
Athenna application. An entry for most of these formatters is
already present in your application's `config/logging.ts`
configuration file, so be sure to review this file to become
familiar with its contents:

| Formatter name |                                                                                             Description |
|:---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `cli`          |                                                                  Simple very useful when building CLI's |
| `json`         |                                     Format the entire data provided by the log message to a JSON string |
| `simple`       |                                      Format the log message to show the level, date, message and the MS |
| `request`      |                   Focus in formatting the log message with common fields that shows up in http requests |
| `message`      | Format the log message with an emoji of it respective level, useful for using with drivers like Discord |

### Writing using specific formatter

It is also possible to set `formatter` and `formatterConfig`
in runtime configurations when using the `Log` facade:

```typescript
import chalk from 'chalk'

const config = {
    formatter: 'simple',
    formatterConfig: { chalk: chalk.green }
}

Log.config(config).channel('slack').info('Hello from Athenna!')
```

### Implementing your own formatter

You can implement your own `Log` formatter using the
`FormatterFactory` class, but your class needs to implement
the `format` method and extends `Formatter` class:

```typescript
import { Formatter } from '@athenna/logger'

export class ConsoleLogFormatter extends Formatter {
  public format(message: string): string {
    const level = this.simpleLevel()

    let messageFormatted = this.clean(
      `${level} - ${this.timestamp()} - (${this.pid()}) ${this.applyColors(
        message,
      )}`,
    )

    if (this.configs.addFoo) {
        messageFormatted = messageFormatted.concat('- FOO')
    }

    return messageFormatted
  }
}
```

Now we just need to use the `FormatterFactory` to register our new formatter and set a name for him:

```typescript
import { FormatterFactory } from '@athenna/logger'

FormatterFactory.createFormatter('consoleLog', ConsoleLogFormatter)
```

Finally, we can start using our new formatter in channels of `config/logging.js`:

```typescript
channels: {
    consoleLogChannel: {
        driver: 'consoleLog',
        addBar: true,

        formatter: 'consoleLog',
        formatterConfig: {
            addFoo: true
        }
    }
}
```
