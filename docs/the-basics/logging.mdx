## Introduction {#id-introduction}

To help you learn more about what's happening within your application, Athenna provides robust logging services that
allow you to log messages to files, console, buckets and even to Slack to notify your entire team.

Athenna logging is based on "channels". Each channel represents a specific way of writing log information. For example,
the `application` channel writes log of your application when bootstrapping, while the `requests` channel writes log of
the http requests that your application receives.

Under the hood, Athenna utilizes the [`Pino`](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) library, which provides support for a
variety of powerful log handlers. Athenna makes it a cinch to configure these handlers, allowing you to mix and match
them to customize your application's log handling.

## Configuration {#id-configuration}

All the configuration options for your application's logging behavior is housed in the `config/logging` configuration file.
This file allows you to configure your application's log channels, so be sure to review each of the available channels
and their options. We'll review a few common options below.

### Available channel drivers

Each log channel is powered by a "driver". The driver determines how and where the log message is actually transported.
The following log channel drivers are available in every Athenna application. An entry for most of these drivers is
already present in your application's `config/logging` configuration file, so be sure to review this file to become
familiar with its contents:

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><code>console</code></td>
        <td>A driver that transports the log to the stdout/stderr using process.stdout.write</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>debug</code></td>
        <td>A driver that transports the log using the debug library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>file</code></td>
        <td>A driver that transports the log to a file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>null</code></td>
        <td>A driver that discards all log messages</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>pino</code></td>
        <td>A driver that transports the log using the pino library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>slack</code></td>
        <td>A driver that transports the log message to a slack channel</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
