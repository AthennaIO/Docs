## Introduction {#id-introduction}

The CLI application of Athenna can run in three ways. Using the `node artisan`, the npm scripts inside package.json file
or linking the package.json using `npm link`, this way you can execute your CLI anywhere from your terminal. As node artisan
and npm scripts comes by default in your application, we are going to focus in `npm link` in this documentation.

## Registering your CLI command {#id-registering-your-cli-command}

To register your CLI command name you can simply add the `bin` object inside your package.json file:

```json
"bin": {
  "yourCliCommand": "dist/bootstrap/main.js"
}
```

:::tip
As you can see your command is pointing to the `dist/bootstrap/main.js` file. So remember running `npm run build`  to
build your code when you want to "test in production".
:::

## Entrypoint file {#id-entrypoint-file}

In our example we defined the `dist/bootstrap/main.js` file as the entrypoint file of our CLI. By default, this file
comes with the `#!/usr/bin/env node` in the top of the file. Without this line the `npm link` command will not work.
So just in case you want to define a different entrypoint file, remember that `#!/usr/bin/env node` should be on the top
of this file.

## Linking the package.json {#id-linking-the-packageJson}

Now you just need to run the following command in your project root:

```shell
npm link
```

And now the `yourCliCommand` will exist in your actual Node.js version:

```shell
yourCliCommand --help
```
