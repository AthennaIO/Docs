# ORM: Extending Models

See how to extend models implementations in Athenna Framework.

## Introduction

All the Athenna models extends the
[`BaseModel`](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Database/blob/develop/src/models/BaseModel.ts) 
class of the `@athenna/database` package. This class
provides everything that a model needs to communicate with database
in the best way possible. But sometimes you may need to write your 
own methods depending on your business logic and to save some time. 
You will see on this page how you can easily create your own static
and instance methods for your models.

:::tip

Also, we recommend you to take a look at the implementation of the 
[`BaseModel`](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Database/blob/develop/src/models/BaseModel.ts) 
class, this way you could have more knowledge about all the methods 
available for your in the `this` property when implementing your own methods.

:::

## Writing static methods

Let's start by defining a new static method in our 
`User` model that will retrieve a user and also load 
relationships:

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  public static async findWith(relation: string, where: Partial<InstanceType<User>> = {}): Promise<User> {
      const query = this.query().with(relationName)

      // Verify if the where object is not
      // empty to apply it in the query.
      if (Object.keys(where).length) {
          query.where(where)
      }

      return this.query().with(relationName).find()
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

Now we can start finding our user with his relations with a little less code:

```typescript
const user = await User.findWith('posts', { id: 1 })
```

Let's implement another method that will get all the users that were 
created in the last 15 minutes ordering then by name:

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  public static async getRecentlyCreatedUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
      const nowDate = new Date()
      const nowDateLessFifteenMinutes = new Date(nowDate - 15 * 60000)

      return this.query()
        .whereBetween('createdAt', [nowDate, nowDateLessFifteenMinutes])
        .findMany()
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

Calling our new static method:

```typescript
const recentlyUsers = await User.getRecentlyCreatedUsers()
```

## Writing instance methods

You can also implement your own instance methods for your 
models. Let's implement a new instance method that will 
confirm the user email:

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
   public async confirmEmailNow() {
     this.emailVerifiedAt = new Date()

     await this.save()
   }

  /*...*/
}
```

Now we can easily confirm the user email with one 
method call:

```typescript
const user = await User.find()

await user.confirmEmailNow()
```

Now let's implement a method that will load the user 
posts if they are not loaded and also get the oldest 
post of the user:

```typescript
import { type Post } from '#src/models/Post'
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
   public async getOldestPost(): Promise<Post> {
     if (!this.posts) {
         await this.load('posts', query => query.oldest())
     }

     return this.posts[0]
   }

  /*...*/
}
```

Using our new method:

```typescript
const user = await User.find()
const oldestPost = await user.getOldestPost()
```

:::tip

Always be carefully to not break the single responsibility principle 
of [`SOLID`](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898) 
when implementing your own model methods. But you are free to do whatever 
you want with Athenna ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™. All of these methods implementations will always
depend on your business logic and creativity.
