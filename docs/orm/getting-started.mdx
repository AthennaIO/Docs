## Introduction {#id-introduction}

Athenna has an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using the Athenna ORM,
each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from
the database table, the models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.

:::tip
Before getting started, be sure to configure a database connection in your application's `config/database.js` configuration file.
For more information on configuring your database, check out [`the database configuration documentation.`](/docs/database/getting-started#id-configuration)
:::

## Generating models {#id-generating-models}

To get started, let's create a model. Models typically live in the `app/Models` directory and extend the
[`Model`](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Database/blob/develop/src/Models/Model.js) class. You may use the `make:model` Artisan
command to generate a new model:

```shell
node artisan make:model Flight
```

## Model conventions {#id-model-conventions}

Models generated by the `make:model` command will be placed in the `app/Models` directory. Let's examine a basic model
class and discuss some of Model's key conventions:

```javascript
import { Model } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends Model {

}
```

### Table names {#id-table-names}

After glancing at the example above, you may have noticed that we did not tell the model which database table corresponds to
our `Flight` model. By convention, the "snake_case", plural name of the class will be used as the table name unless another
name is explicitly specified. So, in this case, the model will assume the `Flight` model stores records in the `flights` table,
while an `AirTrafficController` model would store records in an `air_traffic_controllers` table.

If your model's corresponding database table does not fit this convention, you may manually specify the model's table name by
defining a static getter `table` on the model:

```javascript
import { Model } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends Model {
  static get table() {
      return 'my_flights'
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

### Primary keys {#id-primary-keys}

The model will also assume that each model's corresponding database table has a primary key column named id. If necessary,
you may define a static getter `primaryKey` on your model to specify a different column that serves as your model's primary
key:

```javascript
import { Model } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends Model {
  static get primaryKey() {
      return 'id'
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

### Default attributes vales {#id-default-attributes-values}

By default, a newly instantiated model instance will not contain any attribute values. If you would like to define the default values
for some of your model's attributes, you may define a static getter `attributes` on your model:

```javascript
import { Uuid } from '@athenna/common'
import { Model } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends Model {
  static get attributes() {
      return {
          id: Uuid.generate()
      }
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

As you can see we are defining an `id` property in our static getter `attributes`. This property will have the value of a generated
uuid randomly everytime that Athenna calls the `attributes` getter. This means that `attributes` is totally different from the default
values that you set in your database migrations. Athenna will call the `attributes` getter everytime that `create` and `createMany`
methods are called, this means that a new uuid will be generated for each call:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const flight1 = await Flight.create()
const flight2 = await Flight.query().create()

console.log(flight1.id) // -> 43bf66ec-658a-4f59-8f89-2aac5ae96e6a
console.log(flight2.id) // -> cbe35c9c-60f3-11ed-9b6a-0242ac120002
```

:::tip
But always remember that if you have already set the attribute in one of these methods, the `attributes` getter will not subscribe then:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

// Setting my own id attribute
const flight = await Flight.create({ id: '299dabf8-60f4-11ed-9b6a-0242ac120002' })

console.log(flight.id) // -> 299dabf8-60f4-11ed-9b6a-0242ac120002
```
:::

### Schemas {#id-schemas}

The schemas are very important for Athenna models to work as a "dictionary". When you define a value in your schema you need to
use the `Column` class to define all the options available in your database:

```javascript
import { Model, Column } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends Model {
  static schema() {
    return {
      id: Column.autoIncrementedInt(),
      title: Column.string('flight_title'),
      createdAt: Column.createdAt(),
      updatedAt: Column.updatedAt(),
    }
  }
}
```

### UUID Keys {#id-uuid-keys}

Instead of using auto-incrementing integers as your model's primary keys, you may choose to use UUIDs instead. UUIDs are
universally unique alphanumeric identifiers that are 36 characters long.

If you would like a model to use a UUID key instead of an auto-incrementing integer key, you may use the `Column.autoIncrementedUuid`
method in your primary key and then set what is your primary key (the default is already the `id` property). Athenna will automatically
identify if you are using UUID's in your primary key and generate a new uuid after creating some record in your database:

```javascript
import { Model, Column } from '@athenna/database'

export class Article extends Model {
  static get primaryKey() {
      return 'id'
  }

  static schema() {
    return {
      id: Column.autoIncrementedUuid(),
      title: Column.string('my_title'),
    }
  }
}

const article = await Article.create({ title: 'Traveling to Mozambique' })

console.log(article.id) // -> 84b7cdcf-9e97-4547-ae3a-ec652c08f5ac
```

### Database connections {#id-database-connections}

By default, all models will use the default database connection that is configured for your application. If you would like
to specify a different connection that should be used when interacting with a particular model, you should define a
static getter `connection` on the model:

```javascript
import { Model } from '@athenna/database'

export class Article extends Model {
  static get connection() {
      return 'mysql'
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

## Retrieving models {#id-retrieving-models}

Once you have created a model and its associated database table, you are ready to start retrieving data from your database. You can think of each model as a
powerful query builder allowing you to fluently query the database table associated with the model. The model's `findMany` method will retrieve all the records
from the model's associated database table:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const flights = await Flight.findMany()

flights.forEach(flight => console.log(flight.name))
```

### Building queries {#id-building-queries}

The model `findMany` method will return all the results in the model's table. However, since each model serves as a query builder, you may invoke the `query`
method first and add additional constraints to queries and then invoke the `findMany` method to retrieve the results:

```javascript
const flights = await Flight.query()
        .where('active', 1)
        .orderBy('name')
        .limit(10)
        .findMany()
```

:::tip
Since models are query builders, you should review all the methods provided by [`Athenna's query builder`](https://athenna.io/docs/database/query-builder).
You may use any of these methods when writing your model queries.
:::

### Refreshing models {#id-refreshing-models}

If you already have an instance of an model that was retrieved from the database, you can "refresh" the model using the `fresh` and `refresh` methods. The `fresh`
method will re-retrieve the model from the database. The existing model instance will not be affected:

```javascript
const flight = await Flight.find({ number: 'FR 900' })

const freshFlight = await flight.fresh()
```

The `refresh` method will re-hydrate the existing model using fresh data from the database. In addition, all of its loaded relationships will be refreshed as well:

```javascript
const flight = await Flight.find({ number: 'FR 900' })

flight.number = 'FR 456'

await flight.refresh()

console.log(flight.number) // -> "FR 900"
```

## Pagination {#id-pagination}

The Athenna models also has a `paginate` method that works exact like the [`paginate method from the query builder:`](/docs/database/query-builder#id-pagination)

```javascript
const page = 0
const limit = 10
const resourceUrl = '/flights'
const where = { active: 1 }

const { data, meta, links } = await Flight.paginate(page, limit, resourceUrl, where)
```

You can also use the `paginate` method when working with the `ModelQueryBuilder:`

```javascript
const page = 0
const limit = 10
const resourceUrl = '/flights'

const { data, meta, links } = await Flight.query()
        .where({ active: 1 })
        .paginate(page, limit, resourceUrl)
```

## Collections {#id-collections}

As we have seen, the models method `findMany` retrieve multiple records from the database. However, the Athenna model has a `collection` method that will also retrieve
multiple records from the database but return it as an instance of the [`Collection`](/docs/digging-deeper/collections) class.

The Collection class provides a variety of helpful methods for interacting with data collections. For example, the `reject` method may be used to remove models from a
collection based on the results of an invoked closure:

```javascript
const flights = await Flight.collection({ destination: 'Paris' })

const availableFlights = flights.reject(flight => flight.cancelled)
```

## Retrieve single models & Aggregates {#id-retrieve-single-models-and-aggregates}

In addition to retrieving all the records matching a given query, you may also retrieve single records using the `find` method. Instead of returning an array or
collection of models, this method return a single model instance:

```javascript
const flight = await Flight.find({ id: 1 })

const flight = await Flight.find({ active: 1 })

const flight = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).find()
```

Sometimes you may wish to perform some other action if no results are found. The `findOr` method will return a single model instance or, if no results are found,
execute the given closure. The value returned by the closure **will be considered the result of the method:**

```javascript
const flight = await Flight.findOr({ id: 1 }, async () => {
    // ...
})

const flight = await Flight.query()
        .where('legs', '>', 3)
        .findOr(async () => {
            // ...
        })
```

### Not found exceptions {#id-not-found-exceptions}

Sometimes you may wish to throw an exception if a model is not found. This is particularly useful in routes or controllers. The `findOrFail` method will retrieve
the first result of the query; however, if no result is found, an `ModelNotFoundException` will be thrown:

```javascript
const flight = await Flight.findOrFail({ id: 1 })

const flight = await Flight.query().where('legs', '>', 3).findOrFail()
```

### Retrieving aggregates {#id-retrieving-aggregates}

When interacting with models, you may also use the `count`, `sum`, `max`, and other aggregate methods provided by the [`Athenna query builder`](/docs/database/query-builder).
As you might expect, these methods return a scalar value instead of a model instance:

```javascript
const count = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).count()

const max = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).max('price')
```

:::warning
Aggregate methods will not exist directly in your models, you will always need to call the `query` method first and then execute it using one of then.
:::

## Inserting & Updating models {#id-inserting-and-updating-models}

### Inserts {#id-inserts}

Of course, when using the models, we don't only need to retrieve then from the database. We also need to insert new records. Thankfully, the models makes it simple.
To insert a new record into the database, you should instantiate a new model instance and set attributes on the model. Then, call the `save` method on the model instance:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const flight = new Flight()

flight.name = 'Brazil to Ukraine'

await flight.save()
```

In this example, we assign the `name` field to the name attribute of the `#app/Models/Flight` model instance. When we call the `save` method, a record will be inserted into
the database. The model's `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps will automatically be set when the `save` method is called, so there is no need to set them manually.

Alternatively, you may use the `create` method to "save" a new model using a single statement. The inserted model instance will be returned to you by the `create` method:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const flight = await Flight.create({ name: 'Brazil to Angola' })
```

However, we highly recommend that before using the `create` method, you specify the static getter `persistOnly` on your model class. This property will help your models to
get protected against mass assignment vulnerabilities. To learn more about mass assignment, please consult the [`mass assignment documentation.`](/docs/orm/getting-started#id-mass-assignment)

### Updates {#id-updates}

The `save` method may also be used to update models that already exist in the database. To update a model, you should retrieve it and set any attributes
you wish to update. Then, you should call the model's `save` method. Again, the `updatedAt` timestamp will automatically be updated, so there is no need
to manually set its value:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const flight = await Flight.query()
    .where({ id: 1 })
    .find()

flight.name = 'Paris to London'

await flight.save()
```

#### Mass updates {#id-mass-updates}

Updates can also be performed against models that match a given query. In this example, all flights that are `active` and have a `destination` of `San Diego`
will be marked as delayed:

```javascript
await Flight.query()
      .where('active', 1)
      .where('destination', 'San Diego')
      .update({ delayed: 1 })
```

The `update` method expects a record of columns and value pairs representing the columns that should be updated. The `update` method will always return one
instance of your model if your query only modifies one value. If you query modifies more than one the `update` method will return an array of your models
instance.

### Mass assignment {#id-mass-assignment}

You may use the `create` method to "save" a new model using a single statement. The inserted model instance will be returned to you by the method:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const flight = await Flight.create({
    name: 'London to Korea',
})
```

However, before using the `create` method, we extremely recommend you to specify the static getter `persistOnly` on your model class. This property are
will help you to stay protected against mass assignment vulnerabilities.

A mass assignment vulnerability occurs when a user passes an unexpected field using some object and that field changes a column in your database that
you did not expect. For example, a malicious user might send an `isAdmin` parameter through an HTTP request, which is then passed to your model's `create`
method, allowing the user to escalate themselves to an administrator.

So, to get started, you should define which model attributes you want to make mass assignable. You may do this using the static getter `persistOnly` on
the model. For example, let's make the `name` attribute of our Flight model mass assignable:

```javascript
import { Model } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends Model {
  static get persistOnly() {
    return ['name']
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

Once you have specified which attributes are mass assignable, you may use the `create` method to insert a new record in the database. The `create`
method returns the newly created model instance:

```javascript
const flight = await Flight.create({ name: 'London to Paris' })
```

### Allowing mass assignment {#id-allowing-mass-assignment}

If you would like to make all of your attributes mass assignable, you may define your model's static getter `persistOnly` as an array returning an
asterisk (`['*']`). If you choose to unguarded your model, you should take special care to always hand-craft the arrays passed to `create` and `update`
methods:

```javascript
static get persistOnly() {
    return ['*']
}
```

:::tip
By default, the Model class already implements the static getter `persistOnly` returning the array with asterisk (`['*']`). So if you don't want mass
assignment protection, you could only delete this getter from your model:

```javascript
import { Model } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends Model {
  /*...*/
}
```
:::

#### Allowing mass assignment for some calls {#id-allowing-mass-assignment-for-some-calls}

You can also allow mass assignment when calling your `create`, `createMany`, `createOrUpdate` and `update` methods:

```javascript
const data = { name: 'Brazil to Mexico' }
const where = { active: 1 }
const ignorePersistOnly = true

await Flight.create(data, ignorePersistOnly)
await Flight.query().create(data, ignorePersistOnly)

await Flight.createMany([data], ignorePersistOnly)
await Flight.query().createMany([data], ignorePersistOnly)

await Flight.createOrUpdate(where, data, ignorePersistOnly)
await Flight.query().createOrUpdate(where, data, ignorePersistOnly)

await Flight.update(where, data, ignorePersistOnly)
await Flight.query().update(where, data, ignorePersistOnly)
```

### Insert or update (Upserts) {#id-insert-or-update-upserts}

Occasionally, you may need to update an existing model or create a new model if no matching model exists. The `createOrUpdate` method will update the model
if some record is found by the query that you have built, otherwise the record will be created.

In the example below, if a flight exists with a `departure` location of `Oakland` and a `destination` location of `San Diego`, its `price` and `discounted`
columns will be updated. If no such flight exists, a new flight will be created:

```javascript
const where = {
    departure: 'Oakland',
    destination: 'San Diego'
}
const data = {
    price: 99,
    discounted: 1,
    departure: 'Oakland',
    destination: 'San Diego'
}

await Flight.createOrUpdate(where, data)
```

Or you can use the query builder instead:

```javascript
await Flight.query()
    .where('departure', 'Oakland')
    .where('destination', 'San Diego')
    .createOrUpdate({
        price: 99,
        discounted: 1,
        departure: 'Oakland',
        destination: 'San Diego'
    })
```

## Deleting models {#id-deleting-models}

To delete a model, you may call the `delete` method on the model instance:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const where = { id: 1 }
await Flight.delete(where)
```

You can also delete an instance directly:

```javascript
import { Flight } from '#app/Models/Flight'

const where = { id: 1 }
const flight = await Flight.find(where)

await flight.delete()
```

You may call the `truncate` method to delete all the model's associated database records. The `truncate` operation will also reset any auto-incrementing
IDs on the model's associated table:

```javascript
await Flight.truncate()
```

### Deleting models using queries {#id-deleting-models-using-queries}

Of course, you may build a query to delete all models matching your query's criteria. In this example, we will delete all flights that are marked as
inactive:

```javascript
await Flight.query().where('active', 0).delete()
```

## Soft deleting {#id-soft-deleting}

In addition to actually removing records from your database, the ORM can also "soft delete" models. When models are soft deleted, they are not actually
removed from your database. Instead, a `deletedAt` attribute is set on the model indicating the date and time at which the model was "deleted". To enable
soft deletes for a model, you can just make the static getter `isSoftDelete` return true in your model:

```javascript
export class Flight extends Model {
  static get isSoftDelete() {
    return false
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

You should also add the `deletedAt` column to your database table in your migrations:

```javascript
import { Migration } from '@athenna/database'

export class FlightMigration extends Migration {
  async up({ schema }) {
    return schema.createTable('my_flights', table => {
      table.increments('id')
      table.string('flight_title')
      table.timestamps(true, true, true)
      table.dateTime('deletedAt').nullable().defaultTo(null)
    })
  }

  async down({ schema }) {
    return schema.dropTableIfExists('my_flights')
  }
}
```

And in your Model schema:

```javascript
export class Flight extends Model {
  static get isSoftDelete() {
    return false
  }

  static schema() {
    return {
      id: Column.autoIncrementedInt(),
      title: Column.string('flight_title'),
      createdAt: Column.createdAt(),
      updatedAt: Column.updatedAt(),
      deletedAt: Column.deletedAt(),
    }
  }

  /*...*/
}
```

Now, when you call the `delete` method on the model, Athenna will update your model with setting the current date and time in your `deletedAt` column
However, the model's database record will be left in the table. When querying a model that uses soft deletes, the soft deleted models will automatically
be excluded from all query results:

```javascript
const where = { id: 1 }
const flight = await Flight.find(where)

await flight.delete()

// The flight with id = 1 will not be inside the above array.
const flights = await Flight.findMany()
```

To determine if a given model instance has been soft deleted, you may use the `isTrashed` method:

```javascript
if (flight.isTrashed()) {
    //
}
```

### Restoring soft delete models {#id-restoring-soft-delete-models}

Sometimes you may wish to "un-delete" a soft deleted model. To restore a soft deleted model, you may call the `restore` method on a model instance. The
`restore` method will set the model's `deletedAt` column to `null`:

```javascript
await flight.restore()
```

You may also use the `restore` method in a query to restore multiple models:

```javascript
const flights = await Flight.query()
    .where('airlineId', 1)
    .restore()
```

### Permanently deleting a model {#id-permanently-deleting-a-model}

Sometimes you may need to truly remove a model from your database. You may use the `delete` method with a `true` value in the first argument to permanently
remove a soft deleted model from the database table:

```javascript
const force = true
await flight.delete(force)
```

### Querying soft delete models {#id-querying-soft-delete-models}

As noted above, soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from query results. However, you may force soft deleted models to be included in a
query's results by calling the `withTrashed` method on the query:

```javascript
const flights = await Flight.query()
    .withTrashed()
    .where('airlineId', 1)
    .findMany()
```

#### Retrieving only soft deleted models {#id-retrieving-only-soft-deleted-models}

The `onlyTrashed` method will retrieve only soft deleted models:

```javascript
const flights = await Flight.query()
    .onlyTrashed()
    .where('airlineId', 1)
    .findMany()
```
