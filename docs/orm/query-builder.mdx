# ORM: Query Builder

See how to retrieve, insert, update and delete models using the query builder in Athenna Framework.

## Retrieving models

Once you have created a model and its associated database table, you 
are ready to start retrieving data from your database.

:::note

To see how to create and configure your model, check the
[getting started documentation section](/docs/orm/getting-started)
of the ORM.

:::

You can think of each model as a powerful query builder allowing you to 
fluently query the database table associated with the model. The model's 
`findMany()` method will retrieve all the records from the model's 
associated database table:

```typescript
import { Flight } from '#app/models/Flight'

const where = { active: 1 }
const flights = await Flight.findMany(where)

flights.forEach(flight => console.log(flight.name))
```

### Building queries

The model `findMany()` method will return all the results in the model's 
table. However, since each model serves as a query builder, you may 
invoke the `query()` method first and add additional constraints to 
queries and then invoke the `findMany()` method to retrieve the results:

```typescript
const flights = await Flight.query()
  .where('active', 1)
  .orderBy('name')
  .limit(10)
  .findMany()
```

:::tip

Since models are query builders, you should review all the methods 
provided by [`Athenna's query builder`](https://athenna.io/docs/database/query-builder).
You may use any of these methods when writing your model queries.

:::

### Hidding fields

Sometimes you might need to hide some sensitive field from your model 
queries, to do so, you can set the `isHidden` property to true in your
`@Column()` annotation:

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  @Column({ isHidden: true })
  public password: string

  /*...*/
}
```

Everytime you call the `toJSON()` method of your models, Athenna will 
ignore all the hidden columns from your model and return the rest. 

#### Retrieve hidden fields

Is possible to bypass the `isHidden` validation using the 
`withHidden` option of the `toJSON()` method:

```typescript
const user = await User.query()
  .select('id')
  .select('password')
  .find()

const { password } = user.toJSON({ withHidden: true }) ðŸ‘ˆ
```

## Collections 

As we have seen, the models method `findMany()` retrieve multiple 
records from the database. However, the Athenna model has a 
`collection()` method that will also retrieve multiple records from 
the database but return it as an instance of the 
[`Collection`](/docs/digging-deeper/collections) class.

The Collection class provides a variety of helpful methods for 
interacting with data collections. For example, the `reject()` method 
may be used to remove models from a collection based on the results 
of an invoked closure:

```typescript
const where = { destination: 'Paris' }
const flights = await Flight.collection(where)

const availableFlights = flights.reject(flight => flight.cancelled)
```

And of course, if you need to add more specific constraints to your
query, you can also use the `collection()` method when working
directly with the model query builder:

```typescript
const flights = await Flight.query()
  .select('name', 'destination', 'cancelled')
  .where('destination', 'Paris')
  .collection()

const availableFlights = flights.reject(flight => flight.cancelled)
```

## Pagination

The Athenna models also has a `paginate()` method that works exact like 
the [`paginate method from the query builder:`](/docs/database/query-builder#id-pagination)

```typescript
const page = 0
const limit = 10
const resourceUrl = '/flights'
const where = { active: 1 }

const {
  data,
  meta,
  links 
} = await Flight.paginate(page, limit, resourceUrl, where)
```

You can also use the `paginate()` method when working with the 
`query()` method:

```typescript
const page = 0
const limit = 10
const resourceUrl = '/flights'

const { data, meta, links } = await Flight.query()
  .where({ active: 1 })
  .paginate(page, limit, resourceUrl)
```

## Retrieve single models & Aggregates 

In addition to retrieving all the records matching a given query, you 
may also retrieve single records using the `find()` method. Instead of 
returning an array or collection of models, this method returns a single
model instance:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.find({ id: 1 })
const flight = await Flight.find({ active: 1 })
const flight = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).find()
```

Sometimes you may wish to perform some other action if no results are 
found. The `findOr()` method will return a single model instance or, 
if no results are found, execute the given closure. The value returned 
by the closure **will be considered the result of the method:**

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.findOr({ id: 1 }, async () => {
    // ...
})

const flight = await Flight.query()
  .where('legs', '>', 3)
  .findOr(async () => {
    // ...
  })
```

### Validate model existence

You can also validate if a model exists with determined constraints by
using the `exists()` method:

```typescript
const existsFlight = await Flight.exists({ id: 1 })

const existsFlight = await Flight.query()
  .where('id', 1)
  .exists()
```

### Not found exceptions 

Sometimes you may wish to throw an exception if a model is not found. 
This is particularly useful in routes or controllers. The `findOrFail()` 
method will retrieve the first result of the query; however, if no 
result is found, an `NotFoundDataException` will be thrown:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.findOrFail({ id: 1 })
const flight = await Flight.query().where('legs', '>', 3).findOrFail()
```

### Retrieving aggregates 

When interacting with models, you may also use the `count()`, `sum()`, 
`max()`, and other aggregate methods provided by the 
[`Athenna query builder`](/docs/database/query-builder).
As you might expect, these methods return a scalar value instead of 
a model instance:

```typescript
const count = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).count()

const max = await Flight.query().where('active', 1).max('price')
```

:::warning

Aggregate methods will not exist directly in your models, you will 
always need to call the `query()` method first and then execute it 
using one of then.

:::

## Inserting & Updating models

### Inserts

Of course, when using the models, we don't only need to retrieve then 
from the database. We also need to insert new records. Thankfully, the 
models makes it simple. To insert a new record into the database, you 
should instantiate a new model instance and set attributes on the model. 
Then, call the `save()` method on the model instance:

```typescript
const flight = new Flight()

flight.name = 'Brazil to Ukraine'

await flight.save()
```

:::tip

To validate if a model is persisted in database you can use the 
`isPersisted()` method:

```typescript
const flight = new Flight()

flight.name = 'Brazil to Ukraine'

if (!flight.isPersisted()) {
  await flight.save()
}
```

:::

In this example, we assign the `name` field to the name attribute of 
the `#app/models/Flight` model instance. When we call the `save()` 
method, a record will be inserted into the database. The model's 
`createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps will automatically be set 
when the `save()` method is called, so there is no need to set them 
manually.

Alternatively, you may use the `create()` method to "save" a new model 
using a single statement. The inserted model instance will be returned 
to you by the `create()` method:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.create({ name: 'Brazil to Angola' })
```

However, we highly recommend that before using the `create()` method, 
you specify the `persist` field as `false` in fields you dont want to 
be persisted. This property will help your models to get protected against mass assignment 
vulnerabilities. To learn more about mass assignment, please consult 
the [`mass assignment documentation.`](/docs/orm/getting-started#mass-assignment)

### Updates

The `save()` method may also be used to update models that already exist 
in the database. To update a model, you should retrieve it and set any 
attributes you wish to update. Then, you should call the model's `save()` 
method. Again, the `updatedAt` timestamp will automatically be updated, 
so there is no need to manually set its value:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.query()
  .where({ id: 1 })
  .find()

flight.name = 'Paris to London'

await flight.save()
```

:::tip

To validate if some change has been done in the model after it was
retrieved from database you may use the `isDirty()` method:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.query()
  .where({ id: 1 })
  .find()

if (!flight.isDirty()) {
  flight.name = 'Paris to London'

  await flight.save()
}
```

Also to get only the values that were modified you may use the `dirty()`
method:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.query()
  .where({ id: 1 })
  .find()

flight.name = 'Paris to London'

const { name } = flight.dirty()
```

:::

#### Mass updates 

Updates can also be performed against models that match a given query. 
In this example, all flights that are `active` and have a `destination` 
of `San Diego` will be marked as delayed:

```typescript
await Flight.query()
  .where('active', 1)
  .where('destination', 'San Diego')
  .update({ delayed: 1 })
```

The `update()` method expects a record of columns and value pairs 
representing the columns that should be updated. The `update()` method 
will always return one instance of your model if your query only modifies 
one value. If you query modifies more than one the `update()` method will 
return an array of your models instance.

### Mass assignment

You may use the `create()` method to "save" a new model using a single 
statement. The inserted model instance will be returned to you by the 
method:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.create({
  name: 'London to Korea',
})
```

However, before using the `create()` method, we extremely recommend 
you to specify which fields on your model class should not be persisted 
in database. This property are will help you to stay protected against 
mass assignment vulnerabilities.

A mass assignment vulnerability occurs when a user passes an unexpected 
field using some object and that field changes a column in your 
database that you did not expect. For example, a malicious user might 
send an `isAdmin` parameter through an HTTP request, which is then passed 
to your model's `create()` method, allowing the user to escalate 
themselves to an administrator.

So, to get started, you should define which model properties you dont 
want to be persisted in database. You may do this using by setting the 
`persist` property to false in your `@Column()` annotation. For example, 
let's make the `isAdmin` attribute a filed that could not be persisted: 

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends BaseModel {
  @Column() // By default persist is already `true`
  public name: string

  @Colum({ persist: false })
  public isAdmin: boolean

  /*...*/
}
```

Once you have specified which attributes are mass assignable or not, 
you may  use the `create()` method to insert a new record in the database. The 
`create()` method returns the newly created model instance:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.create({ name: 'London to Paris' })
```

#### Allowing mass assignment for some calls

You can also allow mass assignment when calling your `create()`, 
`createMany()`, `createOrUpdate()` and `update()` methods:

```typescript
const data = { name: 'Brazil to Mexico' }
const where = { active: 1 }
const cleanPersist = false 

await Flight.create(data, cleanPersist)
await Flight.query().create(data, cleanPersist)

await Flight.createMany([data], cleanPersist)
await Flight.query().createMany([data], cleanPersist)

await Flight.createOrUpdate(where, data, cleanPersist)
await Flight.query().createOrUpdate(where, data, cleanPersist)

await Flight.update(where, data, cleanPersist)
await Flight.query().update(where, data, cleanPersist)
```

### Insert or update (Upserts)

Occasionally, you may need to update an existing model or create a 
new model if no matching model exists. The `createOrUpdate()` method 
will update the model if some record is found by the query that you 
have built, otherwise the record will be created.

In the example below, if a flight exists with a `departure` location 
of `Oakland` and a `destination` location of `San Diego`, its `price` 
and `discounted` columns will be updated. If no such flight exists, 
a new flight will be created:

```typescript
const where = {
  departure: 'Oakland',
  destination: 'San Diego'
}
const data = {
  price: 99,
  discounted: 1,
  departure: 'Oakland',
  destination: 'San Diego'
}

await Flight.createOrUpdate(where, data)
```

Or you can use the query builder instead:

```typescript
await Flight.query()
  .where('departure', 'Oakland')
  .where('destination', 'San Diego')
  .createOrUpdate({
    price: 99,
    discounted: 1,
    departure: 'Oakland',
    destination: 'San Diego'
  })
```

## Refreshing models

If you already have an instance of an model that was retrieved from the 
database, you can "refresh" the model using the `fresh()` and `refresh()` 
methods. The `fresh()` method will re-retrieve the model from the database. 
The existing model instance will not be affected:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.find({ number: 'FR 900' })

const freshFlight = await flight.fresh()
```

The `refresh()` method will re-hydrate the existing model using fresh data 
from the database. In addition, all of its loaded relationships will be 
refreshed as well:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.find({ number: 'FR 900' })

flight.number = 'FR 456'

await flight.refresh()

console.log(flight.number) // "FR 900" ðŸ‘ˆ
```

## Deleting models

To delete a model, you may call the `delete()` method on the model 
instance:

```typescript
import { Flight } from '#app/models/Flight'

const where = { id: 1 }
await Flight.delete(where)
```

You can also delete an instance directly:

```typescript
import { Flight } from '#app/models/Flight'

const where = { id: 1 }
const flight = await Flight.find(where)

await flight.delete()
```

You may call the `truncate()` method to delete all the model's associated 
database records. The `truncate` operation will also reset any 
auto-incrementing IDs on the model's associated table:

```typescript
await Flight.truncate()
```

## Soft deleting

In addition to actually removing records from your database, the ORM 
can also "soft delete" models. When models are soft deleted, they are 
not actually removed from your database. Instead, a `deletedAt` 
attribute is set on the model indicating the date and time at which 
the model was "deleted". To enable soft deletes for a model, you just 
need to set up one column with `isDeleteDate` as true:

```typescript
export class Flight extends BaseModel {
  @Column({ isDeleteDate: true }) 
  public deletedAt: Date

  /*...*/
}
```

Now, when you call the `delete()` method on the model, Athenna will 
update your model with the current date and time in your `deletedAt` 
column. However, the model's database record will be left in the table. 
When querying a model that uses soft deletes, the soft deleted models 
will automatically be excluded from all query results:

```typescript
const where = { id: 1 }
const flight = await Flight.find(where)

await flight.delete()

// The flight with id = 1 will not be inside the above array.
const flights = await Flight.findMany()
```

To determine if a given model instance has been soft deleted, you may 
use the `isTrashed()` method:

```typescript
if (flight.isTrashed()) {
    //
}
```

### Restoring soft delete models

Sometimes you may wish to "un-delete" a soft deleted model. To restore 
a soft deleted model, you may call the `restore()` method on a model 
instance. The `restore()` method will set the model's `deletedAt` column 
to `null`:

```typescript
await flight.restore()
```

You may also use the `restore()` method in a query to restore multiple 
models:

```typescript
const flights = await Flight.query()
  .where('airlineId', 1)
  .restore()
```

### Permanently deleting a model

Sometimes you may need to truly remove a model from your database. You 
may use the `delete()` method with a `true` value in the first argument 
to permanently remove a soft deleted model from the database table:

```typescript
const force = true
await flight.delete(force)
```

### Querying soft delete models

As noted above, soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from 
query results. However, you may force soft deleted models to be included 
in a query's results by calling the `withTrashed()` method on the query:

```typescript
const flights = await Flight.query()
  .withTrashed()
  .where('airlineId', 1)
  .findMany()
```

#### Retrieving only soft deleted models

The `onlyTrashed()` method will retrieve only soft deleted models:

```typescript
const flights = await Flight.query()
  .onlyTrashed()
  .where('airlineId', 1)
  .findMany()
```
