# ORM: Factories

See how to factory fake models in Athenna Framework.

## Introduction

When testing your application or seeding your database, you may need to insert a 
few records into your database. Instead of manually specifying the value of each 
column, Athenna allows you to define a set of default attributes for each of your 
models using model factories.

## Defining model factories

First thing you need to do before start using your factories is to define the 
return value of the static `definition()` method of your model:

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public name: string

  @Column({ isUnique: true })
  public email: string

  @Column({ isCreateDate: true })
  public createdAt: Date 

  @Column({ isUpdateDate: true })
  public updatedAt: Date

  @Column({ isDeleteDate: true })
  public deletedAt: Date

  public async static definition(): Promise<Partial<User>> {
    return {
      id: this.faker.number.int({ max: 100000 }),
      name: this.faker.person.firstName(),
      email: this.faker.internet.email(),
      createdAt: this.faker.date.anytime(),
      updatedAt: this.faker.date.anytime()
    }
  }
}
```

The definition method returns the default set of attribute values that should 
be applied when creating a model using the factory.

Via the `faker` helper, models have access to the [`@faker-js/faker`](https://fakerjs.dev/), 
which allows you to conveniently generate various kinds of random data for testing 
and seeding.

## Creating models using factories

Once you have defined the `definition()` method of your model, you may use the 
static factory method in order to instantiate a factory instance for that model. 
Let's take a look at a few examples of creating models. First, we'll use the 
`make()` method to create models without persisting them to the database:

```typescript
const user = await User.factory().make()
```

You may create a collection of many models using the `count()` method:

```typescript
const users = await User.factory()
  .count(3)
  .make()
```

### Creating trashed models

If your model is using [soft delete](/docs/orm/query-builder#soft-deleting) 
approach you can apply the trashed state to your model by calling the `trashed()`
method:

```typescript
const users = await User.factory()
  .count(3)
  .trashed()
  .make()
```

### Overriding attributes

If you would like to override some of the default values of your `definition()`
method, you may pass an array of values to the `make()` method. Only the 
specified attributes will be replaced while the rest of the attributes remain 
set to their default values as specified by the `definiton()` method:

```typescript
const user = await User.factory().make({ name: 'Thais Gabriela' })
```

### Returning specific fields

Sometimes you may need to return only a specific field from your fabricated data.
To do so, you can use the `returning()` method:

```typescript
// Make one User and return it email
const email = await User.factory()
  .returning('email')
  .make()

// Make three Users and return an array with three emails
const emails = await User.factory()
  .count(3)
  .returning('email')
  .make()
```

## Persisting models 

The `create()` method instantiates model instances and persists them to the 
database:

```typescript
// Create a single User
const user = await User.factory().create()
 
// Create three Users
const users = await User.factory()
  .count(3)
  .create()
```

You may override the factory's default model attributes by passing an object 
of attributes to the `create()` method:

```typescript
const user = await User.factory().create({ name: 'Thais' })
```

:::note

[Mass assignment protection](/docs/orm/query-builder#mass-assignment) is 
automatically disabled when creating models using factories.

:::

## Defining relationships within factories

To define a relationship within your model factory, you will typically assign a 
new factory instance to the foreign key of the relationship. This is normally 
done for the "inverse" relationships such as `@BelongsTo()` relationships. 

For example, if you would like to create a new user when creating a post, 
you may use the `returningAs()` method that works exactly like the [`returning()`](/docs/orm/factories#returning-specific-fields)
method, the only difference is that `returningAs()` forces the TypeScript return type
to be the same of the field you are returning:

```typescript
import { User } from '#src/models/User'
import { BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Post extends Model {
  public static definition(): Promise<Partial<Post>> {
    return {
      title: this.faker.commerce.productName(),
      userId: User.factory().returningAs('id')
    }
  }

  /*...*/
}
```
