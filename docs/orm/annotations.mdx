# ORM: Annotations 

Check all available ORM annotations and it options.

## `@Column()`

The `@Column()` annotation marks a model property as a database column:

```typescript
import { Column, BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public from: string

  @Column()
  public to: string

  @Column({ isCreateDate: true })
  public createdAt: Date

  @Column({ isUpdateDate: true })
  public updatedAt: Date
}
```

You can also define any of the following optional properties:


### `name`

> Default: the name of your class property (e.g `name`).

Map which will be the name of your column in database:

```typescript
@Column({ name: 'my_name' })
public name: string
```

The default value of this property will be the name of
your class property as **camelCase**.

### `type`

> Default: the type of your class property (e.g `String`).

Map the type of your column. This property is usefull
only to synchronize your model with database:

```typescript
@Column({ type: Number })
public id: string
```

By default the type of your model will be set as the
type of your class property, in the example above, if
we remove the `type` property, it would automatically
be set as `String`.

### `length`

> Default: `undefined`

Map the column length in database. This property is 
usefull only when synchronizing your model with database:

```typescript
@Column({ length: 10 })
public name: string
```

### `defaultTo`

> Default: `null`

This property doesn't change the behavior in your database,
they are used only when the class property is undefined or 
null before running your model `create()`, `createMany()`, 
`update()` and `createOrUpdate()` methods:

```typescript
@Column({ defaultTo: null })
public deletedAt: Date
```

:::warn

The value set to `defaulTo` property will only be used when
the value for the specified column was not provided when calling
the above methods and also when it was not set in static `attributes()`
method of your model.

:::

### `isPrimary`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column is a primary key:

```typescript
@Column({ isPrimary: true })
public id: number
```

### `isHidden`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column should be hidden when retrieving it from database:

```typescript
@Column({ isHidden: true })
public password: string
```

### `isUnique`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column needs to have a unique value in database:

```typescript
@Column({ isUnique: true })
public email: string
```

:::note

If you try to create duplicated values Athenna will throw an 
exception until it gets in your database. This means that you 
migration could have or not the unique index defined

:::

### `isNullable`

> Default: `true`

Set if the column is nullable or not:

```typescript
@Column({ isNullable: false })
public name: string
```

:::note

Just like `isUnique` property, if `isNullable` is set to false
and you try to create a model with null or undefined `name`, it
will throw an exception.

:::


### `isIndex`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column is an index:

```typescript
@Column({ isIndex: true })
public email: string
```

### `isSparse`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column is an index sparse:

```typescript
@Column({ isSparse: true })
public email: string
```

### `persist`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column should be persist in database
or not. If set as `false`, Athenna will remove this
column from operations like create or update, but it
will still me available in listing operations:

```typescript
@Column({ persist: false })
public name: string
```

### `isCreateDate`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column is a createdAt column. If this option
is `true`, Athenna will automatically set a `new Date()`
value in the column when creating it:

```typescript
@Column({ isCreateDate: true })
public createdAt: Date
```

### `isUpdateDate`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column is an updatedAt column. If this option
is `true`, Athenna will automatically set a `new Date()`
value in the column when creating it:

```typescript
@Column({ isUpdateDate: true })
public updatedAt: Date
```

### `isDeleteDate`

> Default: `false`

Set if the column is a deletedAt column and also if the model
is using soft delete approach. If this option is `true`, Athenna
will automatically set a `new Date()` value in the column when 
deleting it:

```typescript
@Column({ isDeleteDate: true })
public deletedAt: Date
```

## `@HasOne()`

The `@HasOne()` annotation marks a model property as an 
[one-to-one relation](/docs/orm/relationships#one-to-one):

```typescript
import { Pilot } from '#app/models/Pilot'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, HasOne, BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Flight extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @HasOne(() => Pilot)
  public pilot: Relation<Pilot>
}
```

The second argument is an object that accepts any of the following 
options:

### `isIncluded`

> Default: `false`

Set if the relation will be included when fetching data from the
parent model:

```typescript
@HasOne(() => Pilot, { isIncluded: true })
public pilot: Relation<Pilot>
```

:::tip

This option is used by methods like `with()` to eager load your
relation in the parent model:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.query()
  .with('pilot') // ðŸ‘ˆ Set isIncluded to true in query schema.
  .find()
```

This means that if you set this property to `true`, it will by 
default load your relation every time.

:::

### `closure`

> Default: `undefined`

Set a closure that should be called when `isIncluded` is true,
adding to possibility to call methods from the query builder
of the relationship:

```typescript
@HasOne(() => Pilot, { 
  isIncluded: true,
  closure: (query) => query.select('id')
})
public pilot: Relation<Pilot>
```

:::tip

Just like [`isIncluded` property](/docs/orm/annotations#isincluded)
this option is used by methods like `with()` when eager loading your
relation in your parent model:

```typescript
const flight = await Flight.query()
  // Set isIncluded to true and add a select 
  // statement to the relationship query builder.
  .with('pilot', (query) => query.select('id'))
  .find()
```

This means that if you set this property, it will by default be called
when loading your relation without the need to set a second argument to
the `with()` method.

:::

### `primaryKey`

> Default: the `isMainPrimary` of the parent model (e.g `id`).

Define the primary key of the relationship:

```typescript
@HasOne(() => Pilot, { primaryKey: 'myId' })
public pilot: Relation<Pilot>
```

### `foreignKey`

> Default: the parent model name in camel case 
> with an `Id` at the end (e.g `flightId`).

Define the foreign key of the relationship:

```typescript
@HasOne(() => Pilot, { foreignKey: 'myFlightId' })
public pilot: Relation<Pilot>
```

## `@HasMany()`

The `@HasMany()` annotation marks a model property as an 
[one-to-many relation](/docs/orm/relationships#one-to-many):

```typescript
import { Comment } from '#app/models/Comment'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, HasOne, BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Post extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @HasMany(() => Comment)
  public comments: Relation<Comment[]>
}
```

The second argument is an object that accepts any of the following 
options:

### `isIncluded`

> Default: `false`

Set if the relation will be included when fetching data from the
parent model:

```typescript
@HasMany(() => Comment, { isIncluded: true })
public comments: Relation<Comment[]>
```

:::tip

This option is used by methods like `with()` to eager load your
relation in the parent model:

```typescript
const post = await Post.query()
  .with('comments') // ðŸ‘ˆ Set isIncluded to true in query schema.
  .find()
```

This means that if you set this property to `true`, it will by 
default load your relation every time.

:::

### `closure`

> Default: `undefined`

Set a closure that should be called when `isIncluded` is true,
adding to possibility to call methods from the query builder
of the relationship:

```typescript
@HasMany(() => Comment, { 
  isIncluded: true,
  closure: (query) => query.select('id')
})
public comments: Relation<Comment[]>
```

:::tip

Just like [`isIncluded` property](/docs/orm/annotations#isincluded-1)
this option is used by methods like `with()` when eager loading your
relation in your parent model:

```typescript
const post = await Post.query()
  // Set isIncluded to true and add a select 
  // statement to the relationship query builder.
  .with('comments', (query) => query.select('id'))
  .find()
```

This means that if you set this property, it will by default be called
when loading your relation without the need to set a second argument to
the `with()` method.

:::

### `primaryKey`

> Default: the `isMainPrimary` of the parent model (e.g `id`).

Define the primary key of the relationship:

```typescript
@HasMany(() => Comment, { primaryKey: 'myId' })
public comments: Relation<Comment>
```

### `foreignKey`

> Default: the parent model name in camel case 
> with an `Id` at the end (e.g `flightId`).

Define the foreign key of the relationship:

```typescript
@HasMany(() => Comment, { foreignKey: 'myPostId' })
public comments: Relation<Comment[]>
```

## `@BelongsTo()`

The `@BelongsTo()` annotation marks a model property as the inverse side of 
an [one-to-one relation](/docs/orm/relationships#defining-the-inverse-of-the-relationship) and
the inverse side of an [one-to-many relation (many-to-one)](/docs/orm/relationships#defining-the-inverse-of-the-relationship-many-to-one):

```typescript
import { User } from '#app/models/User'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, BelongsTo, BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Phone extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public userId: number

  @BelongsTo(() => User)
  public user: Relation<User>
}
```

The second argument is an object that accepts any of the following 
options:

### `isIncluded`

> Default: `false`

Set if the relation will be included when fetching data from the
parent model:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => User, { isIncluded: true })
public user: Relation<User>
```

:::tip

This option is used by methods like `with()` to eager load your
relation in the parent model:

```typescript
const phone = await Phone.query()
  .with('user') // ðŸ‘ˆ Set isIncluded to true in query schema.
  .find()
```

This means that if you set this property to `true`, it will by 
default load your relation every time.

:::

### `closure`

> Default: `undefined`

Set a closure that should be called when `isIncluded` is true,
adding to possibility to call methods from the query builder
of the relationship:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => User, { 
  isIncluded: true,
  closure: (query) => query.select('id')
})
public user: Relation<User>
```

:::tip

Just like [`isIncluded` property](/docs/orm/annotations#isincluded-2)
this option is used by methods like `with()` when eager loading your
relation in your parent model:

```typescript
const phone = await Phone.query()
  // Set isIncluded to true and add a select 
  // statement to the relationship query builder.
  .with('user', (query) => query.select('id'))
  .find()
```

This means that if you set this property, it will by default be called
when loading your relation without the need to set a second argument to
the `with()` method.

:::

### `primaryKey`

> Default: the `isMainPrimary` of the parent model (e.g `id`).

Define the primary key of the relationship:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => User, { primaryKey: 'myId' })
public user: Relation<User>
```

### `foreignKey`

> Default: the relation model name in camel case 
> with an `Id` at the end (e.g `userId`).

Define the foreign key of the relationship:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => User, { foreignKey: 'myUserId' })
public user: Relation<User>
```

## `@BelongsToMany()`
