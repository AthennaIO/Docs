See how to create relations between models in Athenna Framework.

## Defining relationships

Database tables are often related to one another. For example, a 
blog post may have many comments or an order could be related to 
the user who placed it. Athenna makes managing and working with 
these relationships easy, and supports a variety of common 
relationships that are defined as properties on your model classes
using annotations:

```typescript
import {
  Column,
  HasOne,
  HasMany,
  BaseModel,
  BelongsTo,
  BelongsToMany,
  type Relation,
} from '@athenna/database'

import { Course } from '#app/models/Course'
import { Profile } from '#app/models/Profile'
import { Comment } from '#app/models/Comment'
import { Customer } from '#app/models/Customer'
import { UsersCourses } from '#app/models/UsersCourses'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number 

  @HasOne(() => Profile)
  public profile: Relation<Profile> 

  @HasMany(() => Comment)
  public comments: Relation<Comment[]> 

  @BelongsTo(() => Customer)
  public customer: Relation<Customer> 

  @BelongsToMany(() => Course, () => UsersCourses) 
  public courses: Relation<Course[]> 
}
```

Check the full documentation of relationships annotations:

- [`@HasOne()`](/docs/orm/annotations#has-one)
- [`@HasMany()`](/docs/orm/annotations#has-many)
- [`@BelongsTo()`](/docs/orm/annotations#belongs-to)
- [`@BelongsToMany()`](/docs/orm/annotations#belongs-to-many)

:::

On this documentation you will see how to setup the following
relationships using the above annotations:

- [One To One](/docs/orm/relationships#one-to-one)
- [One To Many](/docs/orm/relationships#one-to-many)
- [Many To Many](/docs/orm/relationships#many-to-many)

## One To One

A one-to-one relationship is a very basic type of database relationship. 
For example, a `User` model might be associated with one `Phone` model. 
To define this relationship, we will place a `phone` property on the `User` 
model and annotate it with the `@HasOne()` annotation:

```typescript
import { Phone } from '#app/models/Phone'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, BaseModel, HasOne, type Relation } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @HasOne(() => Phone)
  public phone: Relation<Phone> 
}
```

The first argument passed to the `@HasOne()` annotation is closure
that return the related model class. Once the relationship is defined, 
we may retrieve the related record using the `with()` method of the
model query builder:

```typescript
const { phone } = await User.query()
  .with('phone')
  .find()
```

Since all relationships are extending `BaseModel`, you may add further 
constraints to the relationship query by adding a closure as second argument
of the `with()` method:

```typescript
const { phone } = await User.query()
  .with('phone')
  .find()

// Or

const user = await User.find()

await user.load('phone', query => query.where('ddd', '+55'))

console.log(user.phone)
```

Athenna determines the foreign key of the relationship based on the 
parent model name. In this case, the `Phone` model is automatically 
assumed to have a `userId` foreign key. If you wish to override this 
convention, you may pass a second argument to the `@HasOne()` annotation:

```typescript
@HasOne(() => Phone, { foreignKey: 'foreignKey' })
public phone: Relation<Phone> 
```

Additionally, Athenna assumes that the foreign key should have a 
value matching the primary key column of the parent. In other words, 
Athenna will look for the value of the user's id column in the `userId` 
column of the `Phone` record. If you would like the relationship to 
use a primary key value other than `id`, you may pass a `primaryKey`
property to the options in the second argument:

```typescript
@HasOne(() => Phone, {
  primaryKey: 'primaryKey',
  foreignKey: 'foreignKey'
})
public phone: Relation<Phone> 
```

### Defining the inverse of the relationship

So, we can access the `Phone` model from our `User` model. 
Next, let's define a relationship on the `Phone` model that 
will let us access the user that owns the phone. We can define 
the inverse of a `@HasOne()` relationship using the `@BelongsTo()` 
annotation:

```typescript
import { User } from '#app/models/User'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, BelongsTo, BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Phone extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public userId: number

  @BelongsTo(() => User)
  public user: Relation<User> 
}
```

When invoking the `with('user')` method, Athenna will attempt to find 
a `User` model that has an id which matches the `userId` column on the 
`Phone` model.

Athenna determines the foreign key name by examining the name of the 
relationship model and suffixing it with `Id`. So, in this case, 
Athenna assume that the `Phone` model has a `userId` column. However, 
if the foreign key on the `Phone` model is not `userId`, you may pass 
a custom key name as the second argument to the `@BelongsTo()`
annotation:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => User, { foreignKey: 'foreignKey' })
public user: Relation<User> 
```

If the parent model does not use `id` as its primary key, or you wish 
to find the associated model using a different column, you may pass a 
third argument to the `@BelongsTo()` method specifying the parent 
table's custom key:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => User, { 
  primaryKey: 'primaryKey',
  foreignKey: 'foreignKey' 
})
public user: Relation<User> 
```

## One To Many

A one-to-many relationship is used to define relationships where a 
single model is the parent to one or more child models. For example, 
a blog post may have an infinite number of comments. Like all other 
Athenna relationships, one-to-many relationships are defined by 
defining a `@HasMany()` annotation in your model class property:

```typescript
import { Comment } from '#app/models/Comment'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, BaseModel, HasMany } from '@athenna/database'

export class Post extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @HasMany(() => Comment)
  public comments: Relation<Comment[]> 
}
```

Remember, Athenna will automatically determine the proper foreign 
key column for the `Comment` model. By convention, Athenna will take 
the "camelCase" name of the parent model and suffix it with `Id`. So, 
in this example, Athenna will assume the foreign key column on the 
`Comment` model is `postId`.

Once the relationship method has been defined, we can access the 
data of related `comments` by using the `with()` method: 

```typescript
const { comments } = await Post.query()
  .with('comments')
  .find()
```

Since all relationships are extending `BaseModel`, you may add further 
constraints to the relationship query by adding a closure as second argument
of the `with()` method:

```typescript
const { comments } = await Post.query()
  .with('comments', query => query.where('title', 'foo'))
  .find()

// Or

const post = await Post.find()

await post.load('comments', query => query.where('title', 'foo'))

console.log(post.comments)
```

Like the `@HasOne()` annotation, you may also override the foreign and 
primary keys by passing the additional options second argument to the 
`@HasOne()` annotation:

```typescript
@HasMany(() => Comment, { 
  foreignKey: 'foreignKey',
  primaryKey: 'primaryKey'
})
public comments: Relation<Comment[]>
```

### Defining the inverse of the relationship (Many To One)

Now that we can access all of a post's comments, let's define a 
relationship to allow a comment to access its parent post. To 
define the inverse of a `@HasMany()` relationship, define a 
relationship property on the child model annotated with the 
`@BelongsTo()` annotation:

```typescript
import { Post } from '#app/models/Post'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, BaseModel, BelongsTo } from '@athenna/database'

export class Comment extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public postId: number

  @BelongsTo(() => Post)
  public post: Relation<Post> 
}
```

And just like the other relationships, once we have defined it in
our class, we can retrieve a comment's parent post by using the 
`with()` and `load()` methods:

```typescript
const { post } = await Comment.query()
  .with('post', query => query.where('title', 'foo'))
  .find()

// Or

const comment = await Comment.find()

await comment.load('post', query => query.where('title', 'foo'))

console.log(comment.post)
```

In the example above, Athenna will attempt to find a Post model 
that has an id which matches the `postId` column on the Comment model.

Athenna determines the foreign key name by examining the name of the 
relationship model and suffixing it with `Id`. So, in this case, 
Athenna assume that the `Comment` model has a `postId` column. However, 
if the foreign key on the `Comment` model is not `postId`, you may pass 
a custom key name as the second argument to the `@BelongsTo()`
annotation:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => Post, { foreignKey: 'foreignKey' })
public post: Relation<Post[]>
```

If your parent model does not use `id` as its primary key, or you 
wish to find the associated model using a different column, you 
may pass a `primaryKey` option specifying your parent table's 
custom key:

```typescript
@BelongsTo(() => Post, {
  foreignKey: 'foreignKey',
  primaryKey: 'primaryKey'
})
public post: Relation<Post[]>
```

## Many To Many

Many-to-many relations are slightly more complicated than one-to-one 
and one-to-many relationships. An example of a many-to-many relationship 
is a user that has many roles and those roles are also shared by other 
users in the application. For example, a user may be assigned the role 
of "Author" and "Editor"; however, those roles may also be assigned to 
other users as well. So, a user has many roles and a role has many users.

### Table structure

To define this relationship, three database tables are needed: `users`, 
`roles`, and `roles_users`. The `roles_users` table is derived from the 
alphabetical order of the related model names and contains `userId` 
and `roleId` columns. This table is used as an intermediate table 
linking the users and roles.

Remember, since a role can belong to many users, we cannot simply 
place a `userId` column on the `roles` table. This would mean that a 
role could only belong to a single user. In order to provide support 
for roles being assigned to multiple users, the `roles_users` table 
is needed. We can summarize the relationship's table structure like so:

```typescript
users
    id - integer
    name - string
 
roles
    id - integer
    name - string
 
roles_users
    userId - integer
    roleId - integer
```

### Model structure

Many-to-many relationships are defined by defining a property annotated
with the `@BelongsToMany()` annotation. But before we check how to define
this annotation, we need to first create our `RolesUsers` pivot model:

```typescript
import { Role } from '#app/models/Role'
import { User } from '#app/models/User'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, BaseModel, BelongsTo } from '@athenna/database'

export class RolesUsers extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public roleId: number

  @Column()
  public userId: number

  @BelongsTo(() => Role)
  public role: Relation<Role> 

  @BelongsTo(() => User)
  public user: Relation<User> 
}
```

And now let's define the roles relation on our `User` model. The first 
argument passed to the annotations is a closure that returns the related 
model class and the second argument is a closure that returns the pivot 
model:

```typescript
import { Role } from '#app/models/Role'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { RolesUsers } from '#app/models/RolesUsers'
import { Column, BaseModel, BelongsToMany } from '@athenna/database'

export class User extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public name: string

  @BelongsToMany(() => Role, () => RolesUsers)
  public roles: Relation<Role[]> 
}
```

Once the relationship is defined, you may access the user's roles using 
the `with()` or `load()` methods:

```typescript
const user = await User.query()
  .with('roles', query => query.select('id'))
  .find()

// Or

const user = await User.find()

await user.load('roles', query => query.select('id'))

console.log(user.roles)
```

To determine the table name of the relationship's pivot table, 
Athenna will call the `table()` method of the pivot model. However, you 
are free to override this convention. You may do so by passing a third 
argument to the `@BelongsToMany()` annotation:

```typescript
@BelongsToMany(() => Role, () => RolesUsers, {
  pivotTable: 'roles_users'
})
public roles: Relation<Roles[]>
```

In addition to customizing the name of the pivot table, you may also 
customize the column names of the keys on the table by passing additional 
arguments to the options:

```typescript
@BelongsToMany(() => Role, () => RolesUsers, {
  pivotTable: 'roles_users',
  primaryKey: 'id',
  foreignKey: 'userId',
  relationPrimaryKey: 'id',
  relationForeignKey: 'roleId'
})
public roles: Relation<Roles[]>
```

### Defining the inverse of the relationship

To define the "inverse" of a many-to-many relationship, is basically
the same process of defining on the parent model. To complete our 
user / role example, let's define the `users` property on the `Role` 
model:

```typescript
import { User } from '#app/models/User'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { RolesUsers } from '#app/models/RolesUsers'
import { Column, BaseModel, BelongsToMany } from '@athenna/database'

export class Role extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @Column()
  public name: string

  @BelongsToMany(() => User, () => RolesUsers)
  public users: Relation<User[]> 
}
```

As you can see, the relationship is defined exactly the same as its `User` 
model counterpart with the exception of referencing the `User` model. 
Since we're reusing the `@BelongsToMany()` annotation, all of the usual 
table and key customization options are available when defining the 
"inverse" of many-to-many relationships.

### Retrieving pivot table data

As you have already learned, working with many-to-many relations requires 
the presence of a pivot table and it pivot model, meaning that if you need
to retrieve the data from the pivot table, you can simply use the pivot model:

```typescript
const user = await User.find()
const role = await Role.find()

const rolesUsers = await RolesUsers.query()
  .where('userId', user.id)
  .where('roleId', role.id)
  .findMany()
```

## Eager loading

Eager loading alleviates the "N + 1" query problem. To illustrate the N + 1 
query problem, consider a `Book` model that "belongs to" to an `Author` model:

```typescript
import { Author } from '#app/models/Author'
import type { Relation } from '@athenna/database'
import { Column, BelongsTo, BaseModel } from '@athenna/database'

export class Book extends BaseModel {
  @Column()
  public id: number

  @BelongsTo(() => Author)
  public author: Relation<Author>
}
```

Now, let's retrieve all books and their authors:

```typescript
const books = await Book.findMany()

for (const book of books) {
  await book.load('author')

  console.log(book.author.name)
}
```

This loop will execute one query to retrieve all of the books within the 
database table, then another query for each book in order to retrieve the 
book's author. So, if we have 25 books, the code above would run 26 queries: 
one for the original book, and 25 additional queries to retrieve the author 
of each book.

Thankfully, we can use eager loading to reduce this operation to just two 
queries. When building a query, you may specify which relationships should 
be eager loaded using the `with()` method:

```typescript
const books = await Book.query()
  .with('author') 👈
  .findMany()

for (const book of books) {
  console.log(book.author.name)
}
```

For this operation, only two queries will be executed - one query to retrieve 
all of the books and one query to retrieve all of the authors for all of the 
books:

```sql
select * from books
 
select * from authors where id in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)
```

### Eager loading multiple relationships

Sometimes you may need to eager load several different relationships. To do 
so, just concat multiple `with()` calls: 

```typescript
const books = await Book.query()
  .with('author') 👈
  .with('publisher') 👈
  .findMany()
```

### Nested eager loading

To eager load a relationship's relationships, you may use "dot" syntax. For 
example, let's eager load all of the book's authors and all of the author's 
personal contacts:

```typescript
const books = await Book.query()
  .with('author.contacts') 👈
  .findMany()
```

:::warning

Closures set as second argument of the `with()` method will be ignored when using 
"dot" syntax to eager load relationship's relationships.

Check the [relationship's relationships constraints documentation section](/docs/orm/relationships#relationships-relationships-constraints)
to see how you could have more power under the constraints added to each of your relationships.

:::

### Constraining eager loads

Sometimes you may wish to eager load a relationship but also specify additional 
query conditions for the eager loading query. You can accomplish this by passing 
a closure as second argument to the `with()` function that adds additional 
constraints to the eager loading query:

```typescript
const users = await User.query()
  .with('posts', query => query.whereLike('title', '%code%')) 👈
  .findMany()
```

In this example, Athenna will only eager load posts where the post's title 
column contains the word `code`. You may call other query builder methods to 
further customize the eager loading operation:

```typescript
const users = await User.query()
  .with('posts', query => query.orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')) 👈
  .findMany()
```

#### Relationship's relationships constraints 

When using the ["dot" syntax](/docs/orm/relationships#nested-eager-loading) to eager load
relationship's relationships the closure set as second argument will always be ignored: 

```typescript
const books = await Book.query()
  // ❌ Load `author` and `contacts` of author, 
  // but doesn't query only cellphones contacts.
  .with('author.contacts', query => query.where('isCellphone', true))
  .findMany()
```

To have full power under the constraints that you want to add to your queries you can
call `with()` method inside of your closure:

```typescript
const books = await Book.query()
  .with('author', query => {
    query
      .where('name', 'Lenon')
      .with('contacts', query => {
        query.where('isCellphone', true)
      })
  })
  .findMany()
```

## Inserting & updating related models

Since all of your relationships extends the `BaseModel`, you can use methods like 
`save()` to create your relationships:

```typescript
const author = await Author.find()

author.book = new Book()

author.book.authorId = author.id

await author.book.save()
```

Or even to update it:

```typescript
const book = await Book.query()
  .with('author')
  .find()

book.author.name = 'Lenon'

await book.author.save()
```

### Creating many-to-many relationships

When working with many-to-many relationships you need to use the pivot model to 
create the relation between the other two models:

```typescript
import { User } from '#app/models/User'
import { Role } from '#app/models/Role'
import { RolesUsers } from '#app/models/RolesUsers'

const user = await User.find()
const role = await Role.find()

const rolesUsers = new RolesUsers()

rolesUsers.userId = user.id
rolesUsers.roleId = role.id

await rolesUsers.save()

// Or simply

await RolesUsers.create({ userId: user.id, roleId: role.id })
```
