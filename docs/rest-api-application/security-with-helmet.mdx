# Security with Helmet

See how to improve the security of your REST API with Helmet in Athenna.

## Introduction

[`Helmet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) helps secure 
applications by setting HTTP response headers. By default, 
Helmet sets the following headers:

- `Content-Security-Policy`: A powerful allow-list of what can 
happen on your page which mitigates many attacks.
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`: Helps process-isolate your 
page.
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`: Blocks others from loading 
your resources cross-origin.
- `Origin-Agent-Cluster`: Changes process isolation to be 
origin-based.
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls the Referer header.
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Tells browsers to prefer 
HTTPS.
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Avoids MIME sniffing.
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`: Controls DNS prefetching.
- `X-Download-Options`: Forces downloads to be saved 
(Internet Explorer only).
- `X-Frame-Options`: Legacy header that mitigates clickjacking 
attacks.
- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`: Controls cross-domain 
behavior for Adobe products, like Acrobat.
- `X-Powered-By`: Info about the web server. Removed because 
it could be used in simple attacks.
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Legacy header that tries to mitigate XSS 
attacks, but makes things worse, so Helmet disables it.

## Basic usage

Athenna uses the [`@fastify/helmet`](https://github.com/fastify/helmet) 
plugin inside `HttpKernel`. All the configurations that 
`@fastify/helmet` supports can be set inside `Path.config('http.ts')` 
file in the `helmet` object:

```typescript
export default {
  helmet: {
    global: true
  }
}
```

## Configuring for specific routes

In Athenna you can set specific options of helmet 
for specific routes. You can also disable the `global` 
option of your `helmet` configuration in `Path.config('http.ts')` 
and set different rules in your routes:

```typescript title="Path.route('http.ts')"
Route
  .get('/hello', 'WelcomeController.show')
  .helmet({ frameguard: { action: 'foo' } }) ðŸ‘ˆ
```

### Usage in route groups

You can also use the `helmet()` method in route groups. 
This will set the same configuration for all routes inside 
the group:

```typescript title="Path.route('http.ts')"
Route.group(() => {
    Route.get('/hello', 'WelcomeController.show')
}).helmet({ frameguard: { action: 'foo' } }) ðŸ‘ˆ
```

:::warning

The `helmet()` method of route groups will never 
subscribe the already set methods of routes. Use it 
to create "defaults" configurations for all routes.

:::

### Usage in route resources

Same behavior as route groups, but for resources:

```typescript title="Path.route('http.ts')"
// Set the same configurations for all routes of resource
Route.resource('/tests', 'WelcomeController').helmet({...})

// Set configuration only for that specific action of resource
Route.resource('/tests', 'WelcomeController').helmet('index', {...})
Route.resource('/tests', 'WelcomeController').helmet('store', {...})
```

## Disabling Helmet

The `HttpKernel` class will automatically disable the
plugin registration if the package does not exist, so
to disable helmet in Athenna you need to
remove the `@fastify/helmet` package from your
application:

```shell
npm remove @fastify/helmet
```

You can also disable by setting `http.helmet.enabled` to `false`:

```typescript title="Path.config('http.ts')"
export default {
  helmet: {
    enabled: false
  }
}
```
