# Controllers

Understand how you can set up controllers in your REST API
application.

## Introduction

Instead of defining all of your request handling logic as
closures in your route files, you may wish to organize this
behavior using "controller" classes. Controllers can group
related request handling logic into a single class. For
example, a `UserController` class might handle all incoming
requests related to users, including showing, creating,
updating, and deleting users. By default, controllers are
stored in the `app/http/controllers` directory.

## Writing controllers

Let's take a look at an example:

```typescript
import { Context, Controller } from '@athenna/http'

@Controller()
export class UserController {
  public async show({ response, params }: Context) {
    return response.send(`User_${params.id}`)
  }
}
```

You can define a route to this controller method like so:

```typescript
Route.controller('UserController').get('/user/:id', 'show')

// or

Route.get('/user/:id', 'UserController.show')
```

When an incoming request matches the specified route URL,
the `show` method on the `UserController` class will be
invoked and the route parameters will be passed to the
method.

## Resource controllers

If you think of each model in your application as a
"resource", it is typical to perform the same sets of
actions against each resource in your application. For
example, imagine your application contains a `Photo` model
and a `Movie` model. It is likely that users can create,
read, update, or delete these resources.

Because of this common use case, Athenna resource routing
assigns the typical creation, read, update, and delete
("CRUD") routes to a controller with a single line of code.
To get started, we can use the `make:controller` command's
`--resource` option to quickly create a controller to handle
these actions:

```shell
node artisan make:controller PhotoController --resource
```

This command will generate a controller at
`app/http/controllers/PhotoController`. The controller will
contain a method for each of the available resource
operations. Next, you may register a resource route that
points to the controller:

```typescript
Route.resource('photos', 'PhotoController')
```

This single route declaration creates multiple routes to
handle a variety of actions on the resource. The generated
controller will already have methods stubbed for each of
these actions. Remember, you can always get a quick
overview of your application's routes by running the
`route:list` command.

### Partial resource routes

When declaring a resource route, you may specify a subset
of actions the controller should handle instead of the
full set of default actions:

```typescript
Route.resource('photos', 'PhotoController').only(['index', 'show'])

Route.resource('photos', 'PhotoController').except(['store', 'update', 'destroy'])
```

### Nested resources

Sometimes you may need to define routes to a nested
resource. For example, a photo resource may have multiple
comments that may be attached to the photo. To nest the
resource controllers, you may use "dot" notation in your
route declaration:

```typescript
Route.resource('photos.comments', 'PhotoCommentController')
```

This route will register a nested resource that may be
accessed with URLs like the following:

```shell
/photos/:photoId/comments/:commentId
```

## Dependency injection and controllers

The Athenna [`service container`](/docs/architecture-concepts/container)
is used to resolve all Athenna controllers. As a result,
you are able to use any dependencies your controller may
need using `@Inject()` annotation or in its constructor.
The declared dependencies will automatically be resolved
and injected into the controller instance when receiving
a request from the server:

```typescript
import { Inject } from '@athenna/ioc'
import { Controller, type Context } from '@athenna/http'
import { UserService } from '#app/services/UserService'
import { ProfileService } from '#app/services/ProfileService'

@Controller()
export class UserController {
  private userService: UserService

  @Inject() ðŸ‘ˆ
  private profileService: ProfileService

  public constructor(userService) { ðŸ‘ˆ
    this.userService = userService
  }

  public async show({ response, params }: Context) {
    //
  }
}
```
