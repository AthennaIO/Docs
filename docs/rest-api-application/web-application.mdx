# Web Application

See how to create web applications using Vite for asset bundling.

## Introduction

[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a modern frontend build tool that provides 
an extremely fast development environment and bundles your code 
for production. When building applications with Athenna, you will 
typically use Vite to bundle your application's CSS and JavaScript 
files into production ready assets.

Athenna integrates seamlessly with Vite by providing an official 
plugin and [Edge.js](https://edgejs.dev/docs/introduction) directive 
to load your assets for development and production. This tool facilitates
the development of full-stack web applications using Athenna as the backend
framework.

## Installing

We recommend to start a new Athenna project to setup all the 
configurations needed to get Athenna + Vite working together: 

```shell
athenna new my-web-app
```

:::note

Don't forget to select `WEB EDGE` or `WEB REACT` when prompted about the 
application type.

:::

## Configuration

The web application adds the `vite.config.ts` file that is used to 
configure the Vite bundler, and a new plugin to 
<Path father="config" child="http.ts" /> named `vite` that is used 
by Athenna on the backend.

### Vite configuration file

The `vite.config.ts` file is a regular configuration 
file used by Vite. Per your project requirements, you can install and register 
additional Vite plugins inside this file. By default, Vite file will use the 
Athenna plugin, which accepts the following options:

#### entrypoints

The entrypoints refers to the entry point file of your frontend codebase. 
Usually, it will be a JavaScript or a TypeScript file with additional 
imports. Each entry point will result in a separate output bundle.

Also, if needed, you can define multiple entrypoints. For example, an 
entry point for your user-facing app and another for the admin panel.

#### buildDirectory

The `buildDirectory` option defines a relative path to the output 
directory. The option value is supplied to Vite as the `build.outDir` option.

If you decide to change the default value, make sure also to update the 
`buildDirectory` path in the `vite` object inside <Path father="config" child="http.ts" /> 
configuration file.

Default: `public/assets`

#### reload

It contains an array of glob patterns to watch and reload the browser 
on file change. By default, we watch for Edge templates in `WEB EDGE` 
application and `.tsx` files on `WEB REACT`. However, you can 
configure additional patterns as well.

#### assetsUrl

It contains the URL to prefix when generating links for assets in 
production. If you upload the Vite output to a CDN, then the value 
of this property should be the CDN server URL.

Ensure you update the backend configuration to use the same `assetsUrl` 
value.

### Vite backend configuration

#### dev

Tell Athenna if should create vite development server or not.
By default, this is controlled by the `Config.get('app.environment')` 
configuration which points to the `APP_ENV` environment variable 
defined in your `.env` file.

#### buildDirectory

It contains the path to the Vite's build output directory. 
You must also update this backend config if you change the 
default value inside the `vite.config.ts` file.

#### assetsUrl

The URL to prefix when generating links for assets in production. 
If you upload the Vite output to a CDN, then the value of this 
property should be the CDN server URL.

#### scriptAttributes

You can use the `scriptAttributes` property to set attributes 
on the script tags generated using the `@vite` tag. The attributes 
are a collection of key-value pairs.

```typescript title="Path.config('http.ts')"
export default {
  vite: {
    scriptAttributes: {
      defer: true,
      async: true
    }
  }
}
```

#### styleAttributes

You can use the `styleAttributes` property to set attributes on 
the link tags generated using the `@vite` tag. The attributes 
are a collection of key-value pairs.

```typescript title="Path.config('http.ts')"
export default {
  vite: {
    styleAttributes: {
      'data-turbo-track': 'reload'
    }
  }
}
```

You can also apply the attributes conditionally by assigning a 
function to the `styleAttributes` option.

```typescript title="Path.config('http.ts')"
export default {
  vite: {
    styleAttributes: ({ src, url }) => {
      if (src === 'src/resources/css/admin.css') {
        return {
          'data-turbo-track': 'reload'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Starting the dev server

You can start your application as usual, and Athenna will automatically 
proxy the needed requests to Vite if the `dev` option is `true` in your
backend vite configuration:

```shell
node artisan serve
```

## Including entrypoints in Edge templates

You can render the script and the style tags for the entrypoints defined 
inside the `vite.config.ts` file using the `@vite` Edge tag. The tag 
accepts an array of entrypoints and returns the script and the link tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    @vite(['src/resources/js/app.ts'])
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

We recommend importing CSS files inside your TypeScript files and not 
registering them separately as an entry point. For example:

```
src
â””â”€â”€ resources
    â””â”€â”€ css
        â””â”€â”€ app.css
    â””â”€â”€ js
        â””â”€â”€ app.ts
```

```typescript title="Path.resources("js/app.ts")"
import '../css/app.css'
```

## Referencing assets inside Edge templates

Vite creates a dependency graph of files imported by the entrypoints 
and auto-updates their paths per the bundled output. However, Vite 
is unaware of Edge templates and cannot detect their referenced assets.

Therefore, we provide an Edge helper you can use to create URLs for 
files processed by Vite. In the following example:

- The `asset` helper will return a URL pointing to the Vite dev server 
during development.
- Return a URL pointing to the output filename during production.

```edge
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('src/resources/css/app.css') }}">
```

```edge title="Output in development"
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost:5173/src/resources/css/app.css">
```

```edge title="Output in production"
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/public/assets/app-3bc29777.css">
```

## Processing additional assets with Vite

Vite ignores static assets not imported by the frontend code. It could 
be static images, fonts, or SVG icons only referenced inside the Edge templates.

Therefore, you will have to notify Vite about the existence of these 
assets using its [Glob imports](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import) API.

In the following example, we ask Vite to process all the files within the 
`src/resources/img` directory. This code should be written within an entry point file:

```typescript
import.meta.glob(['../img/**'])
```

Now you can reference the images within your Edge templates as follows:

```edge
<img src="{{ asset('src/resources/img/hero.jpg') }}" />
```

## Enabling HMR with React

To enable [react-refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh) during 
development, you must use the `@viteReactRefresh` Edge tag. It should be 
written before you include the entrypoints using the `@vite` tag.

```edge
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    @viteReactRefresh()
    @vite(['src/resources/js/app.ts'])
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

Once done, you can configure the React plugin as usual in a regular Vite project.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import athenna from '@athenna/vite/plugins/client'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    athenna({
      entrypoints: ["src/resources/js/app.ts"],
    }),
    react() ðŸ‘ˆ
  ]
})
```

:::tip

We highly recommend you to bootstrap a new project using Athenna CLI
to select `WEB REACT` application type. Will be easier if you start
this new project with everything configured then to try to do it manually,
just run the following and select `WEB REACT` when prompted:

```shell
athenna new my-react-app
```

:::

## Deploying assets to a CDN

After you create the production build using Vite, you can upload 
the bundled output to a CDN server to serve the files.

However, before you do that, you must register the URL of your 
CDN server with both Vite and Athenna so that the output URLs 
inside the `manifest.json` file or lazy loaded chunks should 
point to your CDN server.

You must define the `assetsUrl` inside the `vite.config.ts` 
file and in `vite` object of <Path father="config" child="http.ts" /> 
file.

```typescript title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import athenna from '@athenna/vite/plugins/client'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    athenna({
      entrypoints: ['src/resources/js/app.ts'],
      reloads: ['src/resources/views/**/*.edge'],
      assetsUrl: 'https://cdn.example.com/',
    }),
  ]
})
```

```typescript title="Path.config("http.ts")"
export default {
  vite: {
    buildDirectory: 'public/assets',
    assetsUrl: 'https://cdn.example.com/'
  }
}
```

## Manifest file

Vite generates the manifest file alongside the production build 
of your assets.

The manifest file contains the URLs to the assets processed by Vite, 
and Athenna uses this file to create URLs for assets referenced 
inside the Edge templates either using the `asset` helper or the `@vite` 
tag.
