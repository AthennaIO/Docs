# Views

Understand how you can use the Athenna view API for rendering HTML pages.

## Introduction

Of course, it's not practical to return entire HTML documents 
strings directly from your routes and controllers. Thankfully, 
views provide a convenient way to place all of our HTML in 
separate files.

Views separate your controller / application logic from your 
presentation logic. When using Athenna, view templates are 
usually written using the [Edge templating language](https://edgejs.dev/docs/introduction). 
A simple view might look something like this:

```html title="Path.views('greeting.edge')"
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, {{ name }}</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

And we may return it in our routes using the `response.view()` method
like so:

```typescript
Route.get('/', ({ response }) => {
  return response.view('greeting', { name: 'Lenon' })
})
```

## Views support

Our focus at the moment is to be a framework for backend 
applications development. But since the `View` API exists in 
Athenna ecosystem for creating template files for `make` commands 
of Artisan, providing this feature for you to create monolith 
applications with Athenna is possible, but remember that 
supporting this kind of application is not our focus right 
now.

If you think this is an interesting feature to improve, feel 
free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/AthennaIO/discussions)
at Athenna organization, any contribution is welcome!

## Installation

By default, `@athenna/view` package will already be installed 
in your Athenna project. But you still need to configure it
to be able to use all of it features.

Artisan provides a very simple command to configure the view
library in your project. Simply run the following:

```bash
node artisan configure @athenna/view
```

The view configurer will do the following operations in 
your project:

- Create the `view.ts` configuration file.
- Add all view providers in your `.athennarc.json` file.
- Add all view commands in your `.athennarc.json` file.
- Add all view template files in your `.athennarc.json` file.

## Configuration

All the configuration options for your application's views 
behavior is housed in the <Path father="config" child="view.ts" />
configuration file. We will see later on this documentation 
the purpose of each option:

```typescript
import { Path } from '@athenna/common'
import { Env, Config } from '@athenna/config'

export default {
  disk: Path.views(),
  namedDisks: {},
  components: {},
  properties: {
    env: Env,
    config: Config
  },
  edge: {
    cache: Env('APP_ENV') === 'production'
  }
}
```

## Defining & rendering views

To create a new view, use the `make:view` command:

```bash
node artisan make:view greeting 
```

This command will place a new `greeting.edge` template
within your <Path father="views" /> directory. In this view we 
will render a simple profile with an avatar and the user name:

```html title="Path.views('greeting.edge')
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ name }}</h1> 
  </body>
</html>
```

Edge templates contain HTML as well as Edge directives that
allow you to easily log values, create "if" statements,
iterate over data, and more. Check [Edge documentation](https://edgejs.dev/docs/introduction) 
for more details around the syntax of Edge templates.

Once you have created a view, you may return it from one of your application's 
routes or controllers using the `response.view()` method:

```typescript title="Path.routes('http.ts')"
import { Route } from '@athenna/view'

Route.get('greeting', ({ request, response }) => {
  // Render the Path.views('greeting.edge') template
  return response.view('greeting', { name: 'Lenon' }) ðŸ‘ˆ
})
```

Views may also be rendered using the `View` facade:

```typescript
import { View } from '@athenna/view'

await View.render('greeting')
```

As you can see, the first argument passed to the method corresponds 
to the name of the view file in the <Path father="views" /> directory as defined
in the `disk` options of the [configuration file](/docs/rest-api-application/views#configuration)
of the view package. The second argument is an object of data that 
should be made available to the view. In this case, we are passing 
the `name` variable, which is displayed in the view using [Edge syntax](https://edgejs.dev/docs/syntax_specification).

### Nested view directories 

Views may also be nested within subdirectories of your views 
directory. "Slash" notation may be used to reference nested views. 
For example, if your view is stored at <Path father="views" child="admin/profile.edge" />, 
you may return it from one of your application's routes / controllers 
like so:

```typescript 
return response.view('admin/profile', data) ðŸ‘ˆ
```

### Rendering raw string

You can render raw template string values using the
`View.renderRaw()` or `View.renderRawSync()` methods:

```typescript
await View.renderRaw('<p>Hello {{ name }}</p>', {
    name: 'Lenon'
})
```

:::note

Raw strings do not enjoy the benefits of [template caching](/docs/rest-api-application/views#optimizing-views)
as there are not associated with a unique path.

:::

## Defining & rendering named disks

Named disks could be defined inside <Path father="config" child="view.ts" />
file, in the `namedDisks` configuration:

```typescript
export default {
  namedDisks: {
    admin: Path.views('admin')
  }
}
```

Now you can render templates by prefixing the disk name 
before the template path:

```typescript
return response.view('admin::profile', user) ðŸ‘ˆ
```

For rendering nested views inside named disks you can use "slash"
syntax:

```typescript
return response.view('admin::dashboard/home', user) ðŸ‘ˆ
```

## Sharing data with all views 

As you saw in the previous examples, you may pass an object of data 
to views to make that data available to the view:

```typescript
return response.view('greeting', { name: 'Lenon' })
```

But sometimes you may need to share data with all views that are 
rendered by your application. You may do so by using the `properties`
option inside of the <Path father="config" child="view.ts" /> file:

```typescript
export default {
  properties: {
    env: Env,
    config: Config,
    key: 'value',
    appName: Env('APP_NAME', '@athenna/athenna')
  }
}
```

You can also use `View.addProperty()` method for registering your global
properties:

```typescript
import { View } from '@athenna/view'

View.addProperty('hello', )
```

## View components

Components are regular views created with the purpose of reuse. 
Components can access additional runtime properties like `$props` 
and `$slots`, which are unavailable to other views.

We recommend you create components inside the components directory 
of your `disk` root path. This helps create a visual boundary between 
the components and the rest of the templates used by your application.

Let's start by creating a button component. We will store it inside 
the <Path father="views" child="components/button.edge" /> file:

```html
<button type="{{ type || 'submit' }}">{{ text }}</button>
```

### Using components

You must use the `@component` tag to render a component inside your 
templates. The component tag accepts the template path as the first 
parameter and props as the second parameter:

```html
<form>
  @!component('components/button', { text: 'Login' })
  @!component('components/button', { text: 'Cancel', type: 'reset' })
</form>
```

Output:

```html
<form>
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
  <button type="reset">Cancel</button>
</form>
```

Components from named disks can be referenced by prefixing the disk name:

```html
@!component('uikit::components/button', { text: 'Login' })
```

:::tip

For more information about components, check [Edge component documentation
page](https://edgejs.dev/docs/components/introduction#components).

:::

### In-memory components

You can register in-memory views components by defining them
in the `components` property of you <Path father="config" child="view.ts" />
file. You can find it useful whenever you want to split a large 
template file into several smaller ones or also if you want to 
provide some templates as part of a npm package:

```typescript
export default {
  components: {
    'myuikit/button': Path.node_modules('myuikit/button.edge') 
  }
}
```

You can also create in-memory components without defining any file 
using the `View` facade directly:

```typescript
import { View } from '@athenna/view'

View.createComponent('myuikit/button', '<button {{ $props.serializeExcept(["title"]) }}>{{ title }}</button>')
```

:::tip

You can also use the `View.createTemplate()` method to
register templates. The only difference between them is
that `View.createTemplate()` does not throws errors if
some template name already exists, instead the old template
will be replaced.

:::

You can render the template directly or use it as a component in 
other views:

```html
@!component('myuikit/button', {
  title: 'Signup',
  class: ['btn', 'btn-primary'],
  id: 'signup'
})
```

## Optimizing views

Compiling a template to a JavaScript function is a
time-consuming process, and hence it is recommended to cache
the compiled templates in production.

You can control the template caching using the `edge.cache`
property inside <Path father="config" child="view.ts" /> file. Just make sure to set
the value to `true` in the production environment:

```typescript
export default { 
  edge: {
    // Set to `true` in production only
    cache: Env('APP_ENV') === 'production' ðŸ‘ˆ
  }
}
```

All the templates are cached within the memory. Currently,
we do not have any plans to support on-disk caching since
the value provided for the efforts is too low.

The raw text does not take up too much space, and even
keeping thousands of pre-compiled templates in memory should
not be a problem.

## More details about views syntax

If you want to know more informations about the views syntax like loops,
"if" statements and declaring properties, check out the full [Edge documentation](https://edgejs.dev/docs/introduction) 
for all the details around it syntax.

## Customizing `make` commands templates

The Artisan console's `make` commands are used to create 
a variety of classes, such as controllers, services, 
commands, and tests. These classes are generated using 
`.edge` files that are populated with values based on 
your input. However, you may want to make small changes 
to files generated by Artisan. To accomplish this, you 
may use the `template:customize` command to publish the 
most common stubs to your application so that you can 
customize them:

```bash
node artisan template:customize
```

The customized templates will be located in the 
<Path father="resources" child="templates" /> directory. Any change
you make to these files will be reflected when you
generate their correspoding files using Artisan's 
`make` commands.
