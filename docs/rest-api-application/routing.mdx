# Routing

Understand how you can set up routes for your REST API
application.

## Basic routing

The most basic Athenna routes accept an url and a closure,
providing a basic and expressive method of defining routes
and behavior without complicated routing configuration
files:

```typescript
import { Route } from '@athenna/http' // Route Facade

Route.get('/welcome', ({ response }) => {
    return response.status(200).send({ hello: 'world' })
})
```

### Available Router Methods

The router allows you to register routes that respond to
any HTTP verb:

```typescript
Route.get(url, callback)
Route.post(url, callback)
Route.put(url, callback)
Route.patch(url, callback)
Route.delete(url, callback)
Route.options(url, callback)
```

Sometimes you may need to register a route that responds to
multiple HTTP verbs. You may do so using the `any` method
to respond to all HTTP verbs:

```typescript
Route.any('/', () => {
    //
})
```

:::tip

When defining multiple routes that share the same `url`,
routes using the `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`,
and `options` methods should be defined before routes
using the `any` and `redirect` methods. This ensures the
incoming request is matched with the correct route.

:::

## Redirect routes

If you are defining a route that redirects to another
`url`, you may use the `Route.redirect` method. This
method provides a convenient shortcut so that you do not
have to define a full route or controller for performing
a simple redirect:

```typescript
Route.redirect('/here', '/there')
```

By default, `Route.redirect` returns a `302` status code.
You may customize the status code using the optional
third parameter:

```typescript
Route.redirect('/here', '/there', 301)
```

## The route list

The `route:list` command can easily provide an overview of all the routes that are defined by your application:

```shell
./node artisan route:list
```

By default, the route middleware that are assigned to each
route will not be displayed in the `route:list` output;
however, you can instruct Athenna to display the route
middleware by adding the `-m, --middleware` option to the
command:

```shell
./node artisan route:list --middleware
```

## Route parameters

Sometimes you will need to capture segments of the URL
within your route. For example, you may need to capture
a user's ID from the URL. You may do so by defining route
parameters:

```typescript
Route.get('/user/:id', ({ response, params }) => {
    return response.send({ user: `User ${params.id}` })
})
```

You may define as many route parameters as required by
your route:

```typescript
Route.get('/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId', ({ response, params }) => {
    return response.send({ params })
})
```

## Route groups

Route groups allow you to share route attributes, such as
middleware, across a large number of routes without
needing to define those attributes on each route.

### Middleware

To assign [`middlewares`](/docs/the-basics/http/middlewares)
to all routes within a group, you may use the `middleware`
method before defining the group. Middleware is executed
in the order they are listed in the array:

```typescript
Route.group(() => {
    Route.get('/', () => {
        // Uses first & second middleware...
    })

    Route.get('/user/profile', () => {
        // Uses first & second middleware...
    })
}).middleware(['first', 'second'])
```

### Route prefixes

The prefix method may be used to prefix each route in the
group with a given URL. For example, you may want to prefix
all route URLs within the group with `admin`:

```typescript
Route.group(() => {
    Route.get('/users', () => {
        // Matches only the "/admin/users" URL
    })
}).prefix('admin')
```

## Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header
based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any
origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from
which a browser should permit loading resources.

Athenna uses the [`@fastify/cors`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cors)
plugin inside `HttpKernel`. All the configurations that
`@fastify/cors` supports can be set inside `Path.config('http.ts')`
file in the `cors` object.

Cors plugin is registered in your http application by
default, but you can remove it uninstalling `@fastify/cors`
from your application, or removing the `cors` object key
from your `Path.config('http.ts')` file.
