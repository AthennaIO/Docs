# Error Handling

Understand how you can handle the errors of the REST API application.

## Introduction

When you start a new Athenna project, error and exception
handling is already configured for you. But you can configure
your own extending the Athenna error handler. We'll dive
deeper into how to do that throughout this documentation.

## Configuration

The `debug` option in your `config/app.ts` configuration
file determines how much information about an error is
actually displayed to the user. By default, this option is
set to respect the value of the `APP_DEBUG` environment
variable, which is stored in your `.env` file.

During local development, you should set the `APP_DEBUG`
environment variable to `true`. In your production
environment, this value should always be `false`. If the
value is set to `true` in production, you risk exposing
sensitive configuration values to your application's end
users.

Every error will be logged by default using the `console`
driver from `@athenna/logger`. By default, Athenna uses the
`exception` channel of your `config/logging.ts` file to log
all exceptions that happens in your application.

:::tip

You can change the driver and formatter of `exception`
channel inside `config/logging.ts` file. This way you can
send all your error logs to another provider and with
a different formatter.

## Http exceptions

In `@athenna/http` package there are exported the most
common exception that a http application might throw when
building one. These exceptions were created based on its
status code and the meaning of it:

| Status code |              Exception Class |
|:------------|-----------------------------:|
| 400         |          BadRequestException |
| 401         |        UnauthorizedException |
| 403         |           ForbiddenException |
| 404         |            NotFoundException |
| 405         |    MethodNotAllowedException |
| 406         |       NotAcceptableException |
| 408         |      RequestTimeoutException |
| 413         |     PayloadTooLargeException |
| 422         | UnprocessableEntityException |
| 500         |      InternalServerException |
| 501         |      NotImplementedException |
| 502         |          BadGatewayException |
| 503         |  ServiceUnavailableException |

### The `HttpException` class

All of the above exceptions where created from
`HttpException` class, which is the base class to create
custom http exceptions. If you need to create some http
exception from a status code that is not present above,
create it extending `HttpException`:

```typescript
import { HttpException } from '@athenna/http'

export class PaymentRequiredException extends HttpException {
  public constructor(message = 'Payment required.') {
    const status = 402
    const help = undefined
    const code = 'E_PAYMENT_REQUIRED_ERROR'

    super({ code, help, status, message })
  }
}
```

### Ignore exceptions by status and code

You can ignore an exception from being logged if its status
code or the code does not match your requirements. To do so
you can add the following configurations to the `logger`
property in your `config/http.ts` configuration file:

```typescript
export default {
  logger: {
    enabled: Env('LOG_HTTP', true),
    ignoreStatuses: [404],
    ignoreCodes: ['E_NOT_FOUND_ERROR']
  }
}
```

From now on, all the exceptions thrown in your http
application will not be logged if its status is equal
to `404` or the code is `E_NOT_FOUND_ERROR`.

## Custom exceptions

You can create custom exception by executing the following
Artisan command:

```shell
./node artisan make:exception NotFoundResourceException
```

Next, import and raise the exception as follows.

```typescript
import { NotFoundResourceException } from '#app/Exceptions/NotFoundResourceException'

throw new NotFoundResourceException('Your resource has not been found.')
```

:::tip

Always try to use a custom exception to throw your errors
inside Athenna. If you use `Error`, `TypeError` and other
classes, it will not be treated by the handlers and will
always be considered as a not treated exception.

## Implementing your own exception handler

Let's suppose you want to write a custom logic for handling
your exceptions. You can do so by creating your own
exception handler:

```typescript title="app/Http/Exceptions/Handler.ts"
import { ErrorContext, HttpExceptionHandler } from '@athenna/http'

export class Handler extends HttpExceptionHandler {
    public async handle(ctx: ErrorContext) {
        // Implement your own logic
    }
}
```
