# Tracing Requests

Understand how to trace requests in your REST API application of Athenna.

## Introduction

Briefly, tracing represents a single user's 
journey through an entire app stack. By 
tracing through a stack, developers can identify 
what happened with determined request and also 
identify bottlenecks and focus on improving performance.

## Basic usage

Athenna uses the [`cls-rtracer`](https://github.com/puzpuzpuz/cls-rtracer) 
plugin inside `HttpKernel`. All the configurations 
that `cls-rtracer` supports can be set inside 
`config/http.js` file in the `rTracer` object:

```typescript
export default {
  trace: true,
  rTracer: {
    echoHeader: false,
    useHeader: false,
    headerName: 'X-Request-Id',
    useFastifyRequestId: false,
  },
}
```

When `trace` is set to `true`, the `cls-rtracer` 
plugin will be enabled and a UUID will be generated 
for each request. This UUID will be available in
`request.id` property of your routes:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger'
import { Route } from '@athenna/http'

Route.get('/', ({ request }) => {
  Log.info(request.id) // 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

  return 'Hello World!'
})
```

:::tip

Athenna request logger enabled by `http.logger` 
configuration will automatically log the request 
ID for you.

:::

## Disabling tracer

The `HttpKernel` class will automatically disable the 
plugin registration if `http.trace` is set to `false` 
or if the package does not exist, so to disable tracer 
in Athenna you need to remove the `cls-rtracer` package 
from your application:

```shell
npm remove cls-rtracer
```
