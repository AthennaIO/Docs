# Annotations

Check all available REST API annotations and it options.

## `@Controller()`

Use this annotation to define all the metadata needed to register
your controller into the service container:

```typescript
import { Controller, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Controller()
export class UserController {
  public async index(({ response }): Context) {
    return response.status(200).send({ status: 'ok' })
  }
}
```

You can also define any of the following optional properties:

### `alias`

> Default: `'App/Http/Controllers/YourControllerName'`

Set what will be the alias that your controller will be registered
with in the service container:

```typescript
@Controller({ alias: 'App/Http/Controllers/OtherControllerName' })
export class YourControllerName {}
```

### `camelAlias`

> Default: `undefined`

Set what will be the camel alias that your controller will be
registered with in the service container. Camel aliases are very
useful when you need to resolve your dependency from [`@Inject()`
annotation](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#using-inject-annotation) 
or [automatic constructor injection.](docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#automatic-constructor-injection)

Since controllers were not designed to be resolved using the above
approaches, `camelAlias` will always be `undefined`, but you are
free to define one:

```typescript
@Controller({ camelAlias: 'yourControllerName' })
export class YourControllerName {}
```

### `type`

> Default: `'transient'`

Set the registration type of the controller into the service container:

```typescript
@Controller({ type: 'transient' })
export class YourControllerName {}
```

## `@Middleware()`

Use this annotation to define all the metadata needed to register
your middleware into the service container:

```typescript
import { User } from '#app/models/User'
import { Middleware, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Middleware()
export class UserMiddleware {
  public async handle(({ request, data }): Context) {
    data.user = await User.find({ id: request.param('id') })
  }
}
```

You can also define any of the following optional properties:

### `isGlobal`

> Default: `false`

Define if your middleware will be registered globally for all routes
of your REST API:

```typescript
@Middleware({ isGlobal: true })
export class YourMiddlewareName {}
```

### `name`

> Default: `'yourMiddlewareName'`

Set the name of your middleware that you will use to register it in 
your REST API routes:

```typescript
@Middleware({ name: 'auth' })
export class AuthMiddleware {}
```

### `alias`

> Default: `'App/Http/Middlewares/YourMiddlewareName'`

Set what will be the alias that your middleware will be registered
with in the service container:

```typescript
@Middleware({ alias: 'App/Http/Middlewares/OtherMiddlewareName' })
export class YourMiddlewareName {}
```

### `camelAlias`

> Default: `undefined`

Set what will be the camel alias that your middleware will be
registered with in the service container. Camel aliases are very
useful when you need to resolve your dependency from [`@Inject()` 
annotation](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#using-inject-annotation) 
or [automatic constructor injection.](docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#automatic-constructor-injection)

Since middlewares were not designed to be resolved using the above
approaches, `camelAlias` will always be `undefined`, but you are
free to define one:

```typescript
@Middleware({ camelAlias: 'yourMiddlewareName' })
export class YourMiddlewareName {}
```

### `type`

> Default: `'transient'`

Set the registration type of the middleware into the service container:

```typescript
@Middleware({ type: 'transient' })
export class YourMiddlewareName {}
```

## `@Interceptor()`

Use this annotation to define all the metadata needed to register
your interceptor into the service container:

```typescript
import { Interceptor, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Interceptor()
export class UserInterceptor {
  public async intercept(({ response }): Context) {
    response.body.intercepted = true

    return response.body 
  }
}
```

You can also define any of the following optional properties:

### `isGlobal`

> Default: `false`

Define if your interceptor will be registered globally for all routes
of your REST API:

```typescript
@Interceptor({ isGlobal: true })
export class YourInterceptorName {}
```

### `name`

> Default: `'yourInterceptorName'`

Set the name of your interceptor that you will use to register it in 
your REST API routes:

```typescript
@Interceptor({ name: 'intercept' })
export class AddInterceptInterceptor {}
```

### `alias`

> Default: `'App/Http/Interceptors/YourInterceptorName'`

Set what will be the alias that your interceptor will be registered
with in the service container:

```typescript
@Interceptor({ alias: 'App/Http/Interceptors/OtherInterceptorName' })
export class YourInterceptorName {}
```

### `camelAlias`

> Default: `undefined`

Set what will be the camel alias that your interceptor will be
registered with in the service container. Camel aliases are very
useful when you need to resolve your dependency from [`@Inject()` 
annotation](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#using-inject-annotation) 
or [automatic constructor injection.](docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#automatic-constructor-injection)

Since interceptors were not designed to be resolved using the above
approaches, `camelAlias` will always be `undefined`, but you are
free to define one:

```typescript
@Interceptor({ camelAlias: 'yourInterceptorName' })
export class YourInterceptorName {}
```

### `type`

> Default: `'transient'`

Set the registration type of the interceptor into the service container:

```typescript
@Interceptor({ type: 'transient' })
export class YourInterceptorName {}
```

## `@Terminator()`

Use this annotation to define all the metadata needed to register
your terminator into the service container:

```typescript
import { Terminator, type Context } from '@athenna/http'

@Terminator()
export class UserTerminator {
  public async terminate(ctx: Context) {
    await Log.channel('slack').debug('Request finished.', JSON.stringify(ctx))
  }
}
```

You can also define any of the following optional properties:

### `isGlobal`

> Default: `false`

Define if your terminator will be registered globally for all routes
of your REST API:

```typescript
@Terminator({ isGlobal: true })
export class YourTerminatorName {}
```

### `name`

> Default: `'yourTerminatorName'`

Set the name of your terminator that you will use to register it in 
your REST API routes:

```typescript
@Terminator({ name: 'log' })
export class LogTerminator {}
```

### `alias`

> Default: `'App/Http/Terminators/YourTerminatorName'`

Set what will be the alias that your terminator will be registered
with in the service container:

```typescript
@Terminator({ alias: 'App/Http/Terminators/OtherTerminatorName' })
export class YourTerminatorName {}
```

### `camelAlias`

> Default: `undefined`

Set what will be the camel alias that your terminator will be
registered with in the service container. Camel aliases are very
useful when you need to resolve your dependency from [`@Inject()` 
annotation](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#using-inject-annotation) 
or [automatic constructor injection.](docs/architecture-concepts/service-container#automatic-constructor-injection)

Since terminators were not designed to be resolved using the above
approaches, `camelAlias` will always be `undefined`, but you are
free to define one:

```typescript
@Terminator({ camelAlias: 'yourTerminatorName' })
export class YourTerminatorName {}
```

### `type`

> Default: `'transient'`

Set the registration type of the terminator into the service container:

```typescript
@Terminator({ type: 'transient' })
export class YourTerminatorName {}
```
