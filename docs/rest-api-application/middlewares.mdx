# Middlewares

Understand how you can set up middlewares in your REST
API application.

## Introduction

Middleware provides a convenient mechanism for inspecting
and filtering HTTP requests entering your application.
For example, Athenna includes a middleware that verifies
the user of your application is authenticated. If the user
is not authenticated, the middleware will throw an
unauthorized error. However, if the user is authenticated,
the middleware will allow the request to proceed further
into the application.

Additional middleware can be written to perform a variety
of tasks besides authentication. For example, a logging
middleware might log all incoming requests to your
application.

## Defining middleware

To create a new middleware, use the `make:middleware`
command:

```shell
./node artisan make:middleware EnsureApiKeyIsValid
```

This command will place a new `EnsureApiKeyIsValid` class
within your `app/http/middlewares` directory. In this
middleware, we will only allow access to the route if the
supplied api key input matches a specified value. Otherwise,
we will throw an unauthorized exception:

```typescript
import { Context, Middleware, MiddlewareContract } from '@athenna/http'

@Middleware()
export class EnsureApiKeyIsValid implements MiddlewareContract {
    public async handle(ctx: Context): Promise<void> {
        if (queries.apiKey !== 'my-api-key') {
            throw new UnauthorizedException('Your api key does not match with application api key.')
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, if the given `apiKey` does not match our
application api key, the middleware will return an
unauthorized exception to the client; otherwise, the
request will be passed further into the application.

It's best to envision middleware as a series of "layers"
HTTP requests must pass through before they hit your
application. Each layer can examine the request and even
reject it entirely.

:::tip

All middleware is resolved via the [`service container`](/docs/architecture-concepts/container),
so you can use any dependencies you need within a
middlewares constructor.

:::

## Registering middleware

If you are using `make:middleware` command to register your
middlewares, Athenna will auto register your middlewares
inside the `middlewares` property of your `.athennarc.json`
file:

```json
{
  "middlewares": [
    "#app/http/middlewares/EnsureApiKeyIsValid"
  ]
}
```

:::warning

Remember that if you have not created your middleware using
`make:middleware` command, you will need to manually add it
to `middlewares` array. If you don't do that, Athenna will
not register your middleware in the [service container](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container)
and you will not be able to use it.

:::

### Global middleware

If you want a middleware to run during every HTTP request
to your application, you can set the `isGlobal` value to
true in the `@Middleware` annotation:

```typescript
import { Middleware } from '@athenna/http'
import type { Context, MiddlewareContract } from '@athenna/http'

@Middleware({ isGlobal: true }) ðŸ‘ˆ
export class EnsureApiKeyIsValid implements MiddlewareContract {
    public async handle(ctx: Context): Promise<void> {
        if (queries.apiKey !== 'my-api-key') {
            throw new UnauthorizedException('Your api key does not match with application api key.')
        }
    }
}
```

If you are not using TypeScript you can use the
`globalMiddlewares` array in your `.athennarc.json` file:

```json
{
  "globalMiddlewares": [
    "#app/http/middlewares/EnsureApiKeyIsValid"
  ]
}
```

### Assigning middleware to routes

If you would like to assign middleware to specific routes,
you can use the name of your middleware class in camelCase
(`ensureApiKeyIsValid`). But we recommend you to assign a
custom name to your middleware using the `@Middleware`
annotation:

```typescript
import { Middleware } from '@athenna/http'
import type { Context, MiddlewareContract } from '@athenna/http'

@Middleware({ name: 'auth' }) ðŸ‘ˆ
export class EnsureApiKeyIsValid implements MiddlewareContract {
    public async handle(ctx: Context): Promise<void> {
        if (queries.apiKey !== 'my-api-key') {
            throw new UnauthorizedException('Your api key does not match with application api key.')
        }
    }
}
```

If you are not using TypeScript you can use the
`namedMiddlewares` object in your `.athennarc.json` file:

```json
{
  "namedMiddlewares": {
    "auth": "#app/http/middlewares/EnsureApiKeyIsValid"
  }
}
```

Once the middleware name has been defined, you may use the
`Route.middleware()` method to assign middleware to a route:

```typescript
Route.get('/welcome', () => {
    //
}).middleware('auth') ðŸ‘ˆ
```

## Intercept middleware

Sometimes a middleware may need to do some work **before**
the HTTP response has been sent to the client. For this
 purpose, you can use the Athenna interceptor middleware.
To create one, you can use the following command:

```shell
./node artisan make:interceptor InterceptMiddleware
```

Just like `make:middleware`, Athenna will auto register the
middleware if using `make:interceptor` command. The above
command will produce the following content at
`app/http/interceptors/InterceptMiddleware.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Interceptor } from '@athenna/http'
import type { InterceptContext, InterceptorContract } from '@athenna/http'

@Interceptor()
export class InterceptMiddleware implements InterceptorContract {
    public async intercept(ctx: InterceptContext): Promise<unknown> {
      ctx.body.intercepted = true

      return ctx.body
    }
}
```

:::warning

As you can see in the example above, you should always
return the intercepted response body in interceptors.

:::

The registration process of Athenna interceptors is the
same of [middlewares](/docs/rest-api-application/middlewares#registering-middleware).

To assign your interceptor to a route, you can use the
`Route.interceptor()` method:

```typescript
Route.get('/welcome', () => {
    //
}).interceptor('interceptMiddleware') ðŸ‘ˆ
```

## Terminate middleware

Sometimes a middleware may need to do some work **after**
the HTTP response has been sent to the client. For this
 purpose, you can use the Athenna interceptor middleware.
To create one, you can use the following command:

```shell
./node artisan make:terminator TerminateMiddleware
```

Just like `make:middleware`, Athenna will auto register the
middleware if using `make:terminator` command. The above
command will produce the following content at
`app/http/terminators/TerminateMiddleware.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Terminator } from '@athenna/http'
import type { TerminateContext, TerminatorContract } from '@athenna/http'

@Terminator()
export class TerminateMiddleware implements TerminatorContract {
    public async terminate(ctx: TerminateContext): Promise<void> {}
}
```

The registration process of Athenna terminators is the
same of [middlewares](/docs/rest-api-application/middlewares#registering-middleware).

To assign your terminator to a route, you can use the
`Route.terminator()` method:

```typescript
Route.get('/welcome', () => {
    //
}).terminator('terminateMiddleware') ðŸ‘ˆ
```

:::info

The requests log created by Athenna when the `logger`
property is true in your `Path.config('http.ts')` file are handled
by a terminator middleware! You can see the code [here](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Http/blob/develop/src/kernels/HttpKernel.ts#L93).
