# Directory Structure

Understand the directory structure of your project.

:::important

We highly recommend you to use the `./node artisan make`
command to generate the files of your application. If
using this command, it will automatically generate the
file and register it wherever it is needed. Take as an example
the `./node artisan make:command command`. First it will
generate the file and then will register the command inside
the `commands` map property of `.athennarc.json` file.

## Laravel based structure

### The app directory

The `app` directory contains the core code of your application.
We'll explore this directory in more detail soon. Almost all
the classes in your application will be in this directory.

### The bootstrap directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains all of your application's
bootstrap files. It's here that Athenna holds the `main.ts`
file that bootstrap the application using the `Ignite` class.

### The config directory

The `config` directory contains all of your application's
configuration files. It's a great idea to read through all
of these files and familiarize yourself with all the options
available to you.

### The database directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created
for you if you execute the following command:

```bash
./node artisan configure @athenna/database
```

The `database` directory contains your database migrations,
model factories, and seeds. If you wish, you may also use
this directory to hold an SQLite database.

### The providers directory

The `providers` directory contains all the service providers
for your application. Service providers bootstrap your
application by binding services in the service container,
registering events, or performing any other tasks to prepare
your application to run.

### The routes directory

The `routes` directory contains all the route definitions
for your application. By default, several route files are
included with Athenna:

- The `http.ts` file is where you will define the entry
point of your api using the Route facade that is provided
by the HttpRouteProvider.
- The `console.ts` file is where you will define the entry
point of your commands using the Artisan facade that is
provided by the ArtisanProvider.

:::important

As you may have noticed your project does not have the
`console.ts` file. We only recommend using this file when
you don't want to use TypeScript in your application or
when you want to add some personalized option of [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander)
to your command. Check the example:

```typescript
import { Artisan } from '@athenna/artisan'

Artisan.route('hello', function (helloArg: string, options: { hello: string }) {
    console.log(helloArg)
    console.log(options.hello)
}) // ðŸ‘ˆ Artisan.route return an instance of Commander
.argument('<hello>', 'Description for hello argument.')
.option('--hello', 'Description for hello flag.')
```

:::

### The storage directory

The `storage` directory contains your logs, file caches,
files uploaded locally and other files generated by the
framework. This directory is segregated into the following
directories:

- The `app` directory may be used to store any files
generated by your application.
- The `framework` directory is used to store framework
generated files and caches.
- The `logs` directory contains your application's log
files.

### The tests directory

You can create a test executing the `./node artisan make:test`
command. The `tests` directory contains your unitary and E2E
tests. Each test file name should always end with the word
Test at the end. You may run your tests using the `./node artisan test`
command.

:::warning

If your test file name does not end with `Test`, it will
be ignored and the test class will not run. But, you can
customize this behavior in the configure function of [Japa](https://japa.dev/docs)
inside your `bootstrap/test.ts` file.

## Slim structure

The slim project structure has only three folders when you
create the project:

- The `bin` directory is the same as [bootstrap](/docs/getting-started/directory-structure#bootstrap).
- The `src` directory is used to store all the source code files of your applications.
- The `tests` directory is the same as [tests](/docs/getting-started/directory-structure#tests).

## Do your own structure

There are some files in your project that are crucial to
keep in certain places. Let's analyze some of them:

- The `bootstrap/main.ts` file is the entry point of the
`./node artisan serve` command. Every time that you run this
command, Athenna will use this file to run your application.
- The `bootstrap/artisan.ts` file is the entry point of the
`./node artisan` script. You can check how this works in the
[node script file documentation section](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/node-script-file).
- The `config` path is where you are going to set up your
configuration files. You can learn more about configuration
files at [the configuration documentation section](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/configuration).
- The `routes/http.ts` file is where you are going to register
your Http server routes.

Athenna is a framework with a lot of opinions, with predefined
project structures; it was built that way to make your life easier.
But speaking from developer to developer, we know how much fun it
is to be able to have control over everything in your application,
especially the structure of your project ðŸ˜Ž.

With that in mind, Athenna was built in a fully configurable
way. You can create your files and folders anywhere, even the
one that are crucial to keep in certain places.
