# Athenna RC File

Understand what is the purpose of the .athennarc.json file.

## Introduction

Inside the root directory of your project, there is a file
called `.athennarc.json` which is responsible for configuring
the workspace and certain runtime settings of your Athenna
application.

## RC file vs Configurations

The responsible of the `.athennarc.json` is configuring the workspace
and certain runtime settings to bootstrap your Athenna
application properly. Also, when working with `.json` files is
very easy to manipulate the values of it, making it possible
to make changes on the file in runtime. Let's see an example
where Athenna manipulates your `.athennarc.json`:

```bash
node artisan make:service UserService
```

Athenna will create the service file in your project but
also register it inside your `.athennarc.json` file:

```json
{
  "services": [
    "#app/services/UserService"
  ]
}
```

## Custom RC file path

You can change the name and the path of your RC file or even 
create customized ones for each environment (`.athennarc.dev.json`, 
`.athennarc.prod.json`). To do that you need to set the new 
path to `Ignite::load()` static method:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('dev.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, {
  athennaRcPath: './bootstrap/athennadevrc.json' ðŸ‘ˆ
})

await ignite.httpServer()
```

:::tip

Always remember that when using relative paths to set something
in Athenna, you need to use your project root path as reference,
just like in the example above.

:::

## Using RC file in `package.json`

You can also use the RC file inside `package.json`. By default,
If you don't specify the path of your RC file, and the default 
`.athennarc.json` cannot be found in the root path of your application,
Athenna will check if the `athenna` property exists in your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "athenna": {
    "providers": [
      "@athenna/core/providers/CoreProvider",
      "@athenna/http/providers/HttpRouteProvider",
      "@athenna/http/providers/HttpServerProvider"
    ],
    "directories": {
      "bootstrap": "bin"
    }
  }
}
```

## RC File properties

Let's cover all of the `.athennarc.json` file properties and
understand how to use each one of them:

### The `preloads` property

An array of files that will be loaded when your application
is bootstrapping. The files are loaded after booting the
service providers. You can do anything you want in preload
files. Check the example bellow:

```typescript title="say-hello.ts"
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger'
import { Config } from '@athenna/core'

Log.info(`Hello from ${Config.get('app.name')} application!`)
```

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "preloads": [
    "./bootstrap/preloads/say-hello.js"
  ]
}
```

### The `providers` property

An array of service providers to load when the application
is bootstrapping:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "providers": [
    "@athenna/core/providers/CoreProvider",
    "@athenna/http/providers/HttpRouteProvider",
    "@athenna/http/providers/HttpServerProvider"
  ]
}
```

:::tip

More information about service providers could be found at
[service providers documentation section](https://athenna.io/docs/the-basics/http/controllers).

:::

### The `services` property

This property is responsible to register your application
services or from some library inside the service container.
In most cases, it is better to simply instantiate your services,
but in others you might have different implementations for
some interface, using [inversion of control](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-inversion-of-control)
in these cases could be an exceptional idea to register your
services in the container:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "services": [
    "#app/services/AppService",
    "./app/services/OtherService.js"
  ]
}
```

### The `commands` property

An object that is responsible to register your application
commands and their respective settings. The key of the
commands object needs to be exactly your command signature
without any arguments, flags or spaces. Also, the value
of it could be the command path or an object with the
"path" key inside:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "commands": {
    "make:exception": "@athenna/core/commands/MakeExceptionCommand",
    "make:facade": {
      "path": "@athenna/core/commands/MakeFacadeCommand",
      "env": "local",
      "destination": "./src/providers/facades",
      "loadApp": false,
      "stayAlive": false,
      "loadAllCommands": false,
      "environments": ["console"]
    }
  }
}
```

Depending on the command you are running, it got their
own configurations. Commands like `make:...` for example,
reads the `destination` property to the file generated
for a different path from it default.

There are properties that you can define whatever your
command. Let's see who they are and what they do:

- **`path`** - Defines the path to your command, this field is mandatory 
if you are using an object to define your command.
- **`loadApp`** - If `true`, the `Ignite.fire()` method will be called
until running your command. The `Ignite.fire()` method is responsible
to load your env file and configuration files and also boot your
service providers.
- **`env`** - Defines which env file will be used to run your command. 
This field is not required and it will only be relevant when the
`loadApp` property is `true`.
- **`stayAlive`** - If `true`, your command will stay running until the
event loop is not in use anymore. Very useful for keep running 
background tasks from commands.
- **`loadAllCommands`** - If `true`, all the commands inside the `commands`
property will be loaded. Useful when you command needs to call other command
programmatically.
- **`environments`** - Only relevant when `loadApp` is `true`. The environments
set will be used as parameter for `Ignite.fire()` method and will help
Athenna to select the service providers that should or shouldn't be booted.

More information about commands could be found at
[cli commands documentation section](https://athenna.io/docs/the-basics/cli/commands).

:::

### The `templates` property

Map your application commands templates with their respective
path. The templates mapped in this object will be used by your
`make` commands to generate the resource with some specific
code template:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "templates": {
    "exception": "node_modules/@athenna/core/templates/exception.edge",
    "facade": "node_modules/@athenna/core/templates/facade.edge"
  }
}
```

### The `directories` property

Map your application directories with their respective
base path. The [`Path`](https://athenna.io/docs/digging-deeper/helpers#path)
class will use the directories mapped in this object to
resolve the paths of your application:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "directories": {
    "bin": "bin",
    "src": "src",
    "app": "app",
    "models": "app/models",
    "services": "app/services",
    "exceptions": "app/exceptions",
    "repositories": "app/repositories",
    "console": "app/console",
    "commands": "app/console/commands",
    "http": "app/http",
    "controllers": "app/http/controllers",
    "middlewares": "app/http/middlewares",
    "interceptors": "app/http/interceptors",
    "terminators": "app/http/terminators",
    "bootstrap": "bootstrap",
    "config": "config",
    "database": "database",
    "seeders": "database/seeders",
    "migrations": "database/migrations",
    "lang": "lang",
    "resources": "resources",
    "views": "resources/views",
    "locales": "resources/locales",
    "nodeModules": "node_modules",
    "nodeModulesBin": "node_modules/.bin",
    "providers": "providers",
    "facades": "providers/facades",
    "public": "public",
    "static": "public/static",
    "assets": "public/assets",
    "routes": "routes",
    "storage": "storage",
    "logs": "storage/logs",
    "tests": "tests",
    "stubs": "tests/stubs",
    "fixtures": "tests/fixtures"
  }
}
```

The paths above are the default ones used by Athenna to resolve
your application paths. You can change one of them or many
if you want, your directories defined in `directories` property
will always be merged with the defaults.

Athenna always rely on [`Path`](https://athenna.io/docs/digging-deeper/helpers#path)
class methods to find files and directories that are used
internally by the framework, like configuration file, route
files, entry points and many others. Changing the `directories` property
could be very useful when you are building your own project structure.

### The `controllers` property

An array with the controllers of your application. The
controllers registered in this array will be registered
in the service container to be accessed easily by your
Route facade:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "controllers": [
    "#app/http/controllers/AppController",
    "./app/http/controllers/OtherController.js"
  ]
}
```

### The `middlewares` property

An array with the middlewares of your application. The
middlewares registered in this array will be registered
in the service container to be accessed easily by your
`Route` facade:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "middlewares": [
    "#app/http/middlewares/AppMiddleware",
    "./app/http/interceptors/AppInterceptor.js"
  ]
}
```

Athenna expects that the middlewares set in this property
to be annotated with `@Middleware()`, `@Interceptor()` or `@Terminator()`
annotations, this is not mandatory, but you will only
be able to set the name of the middleware or if it is global or not using
the annotations.

If you are not using TypeScript in your application, you can use the
[`namedMiddlewares`](/docs/getting-started/athennarc-file#the-namedmiddlewares-property)
property to register named middlewares and the
[`globalMiddlewares`](/docs/getting-started/athennarc-file#the-globalmiddlewares-property)
property to register global middlewares.

:::tip

More information about middlewares could be found at
[http middlewares documentation section](https://athenna.io/docs/rest-api-application/middlewares).

:::

### The `namedMiddlewares` property

Map the named middlewares of your application. Named
middlewares could be configured using the `@Middleware()`
annotation, but if you are not using TypeScript in your
application, you can use this object to map your named
middlewares. Named middlewares are very useful to be used
in your route declaration:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "namedMiddlewares": {
    "app": "#app/http/middlewares/AppMiddleware",
    "intercept": "./app/http/interceptors/AppInterceptor.js"
  }
}
```

### The `globalMiddlewares` property

An array with the global middlewares of your application.
Global middlewares could be configured using the `@Middleware()`
annotation, but if you are not using TypeScript in your
application, you can use this object to map your named
middlewares. Global middlewares are executed every time
in any request of your application:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "globalMiddlewares": [
    "#app/http/middlewares/AppMiddleware",
    "./app/http/interceptors/AppInterceptor.js"
  ]
}
```

### The `artisan` property

An object with a variety of Artisan configurations.
At this point the only configurations accepted are `artisan.child.executor`
and `artisan.child.path`. Both configurations are used to define
how the `Artisan.callInChild()` method will behave when no options
are set to it as second argument:

```json title=".athennarc.json"
{
  "artisan": {
    "child": {
      "executor": "node --inspect",
      "path": "./bin/artisan.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

Athenna will automatically parse the `artisan.child.path` using
the `Path.ext()` method, so you don't need to worry about if the
extension is `.js` or `.ts`.
