# Configuration

Understand the initial configurations of your project.

## Environment configuration

It is often helpful to have different configuration values
based on the environment where the application is running.
For example, you may wish to use a different storage driver
locally than you do on your production server.

To make this a cinch, Athenna utilizes the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
Node.js library. In a fresh Athenna installation, the root
directory of your application will contain a `.env.example` file
that defines many common environment variables. During the
Athenna installation process, this file will automatically
be copied to `.env` and `.env.test`.

:::note

If you are not using the slim project structure, you can
create a `.env` file in the root path of your application 
and Athenna will automatically resolve it for you.

:::

Athenna default `.env` file contains some common configuration
values that may differ based on whether your application is
running locally or on a production. These values are then
retrieved from various Athenna configuration files within the
`config` directory using Athenna `Env()` function.

If you are developing with a team, you may wish to continue
including a `.env.example` file with your application. By
putting placeholder values in the example configuration file,
other developers on your team can clearly see which environment
variables are needed to run your application.

:::tip

Any variable in your `.env` file can be overridden by
external environment variables such as server-level or
system-level environment variables. But off course you
can turn off this behavior setting the `OVERRIDE_ENV=true`
variable before running your application, if this variable
is set to true, all environment variables set in `.env`
will override the externals.

:::

:::caution

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application
source control, since each developer/server using your
application could require a different environment configuration.
Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an
intruder gains access to your source control repository,
since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

:::

### Determining the current environment

Before loading your application's environment variables,
Athenna determines if either the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable has been externally provided or if the `--env` Artisan
flag has been specified. If so, Athenna will attempt to load
the `.env.${NODE_ENV}` file if it exists. If it does not exist,
Athenna will try to find the `NODE_ENV` value inside the `.env` file,
if it exists, Athenna will save its value and repeat the process
above. Finally, if the `NODE_ENV` is not present in the file,
Athenna will load the `.env` file by default if it exists.

Running providing `--env` flag in Artisan:

```bash
./node artisan serve --env=local
```

Running providing `NODE_ENV` externally:

```bash
NODE_ENV=local ./node artisan serve
```

Let's check some practical examples. This is the default
`.env` file that comes in Athenna project:

```dotenv
HOST=localhost
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=local

APP_NAME=Athenna
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://${HOST}:${PORT}
APP_DOMAIN=${HOST}
APP_DOCUMENTATION=${APP_URL}
APP_SOURCE=https://github.com/AthennaIO

LOG_HTTP=true
LOG_CHANNEL=application
```

In the `.env` file above, you can see that we have the
`NODE_ENV=local`. This means that if you create a new
`.env.local` file in your project root path, Athenna
will load it instead of `.env` if running your application
without a predefined environment.

### Get an environment variable value

You can get environment variables using the `Env()` function:

```typescript
import { Env } from '@athenna/config'

const defaultValue = 'Athenna'

const appName = Env('APP_NAME', defaultValue)
```

All environment variables in your .env file and inside
`process.env` object are always interpreted as strings.
But when using the `Env()` function, it will auto cast the
value for you. Check the comparison:

| Value in .env                   | 	Value returned by Env function |
|:--------------------------------|--------------------------------:|
| true **(boolean)**              |             	true **(boolean)** |
| "true" **(string)**             |             	true **(boolean)** |
| 10 **(number)**                 |                	10 **(number)** |
| "10" **(string)**               |                	10 **(number)** |
| 10.090909 **(float)**           |          	10.090909 **(float)** |
| "10.090909" **(string)**        |          	10.090909 **(float)** |
| {"name":"Paulo"} **(json)**     | 	{ name: "Paulo" } **(Object)** |
| "{"name":"Paulo"}" **(string)** | 	{ name: "Paulo" } **(Object)** |

Let's see a more practical example of it:

```typescript
process.env.PORT = '3000'
process.env.APP_DEBUG = 'true'
process.env.APP_JSON = '{"name":"Paulo"}'

console.log(Env('PORT')) // 3000 <- number
console.log(Env('APP_DEBUG')) // true <- boolean
console.log(Env('APP_JSON')) // { name: "Paulo" } <- object
```

There will certainly have scenarios in your business rule
where you explicitly need an environment variable with value
`true`, `10` or `{"name":"Paulo"}` to be a string. To solve
this, you can turn off the auto cast when using the `Env()`
function:

```typescript
process.env.PORT = '3000'
process.env.APP_DEBUG = 'true'
process.env.APP_JSON = '{"name":"Paulo"}'

const autoCast = false
const defaultValue = undefined

console.log(Env('PORT', defaultValue, autoCast)) // 3000 <- string
console.log(Env('APP_DEBUG', defaultValue, autoCast)) // true <- string
console.log(Env('APP_JSON', defaultValue, autoCast)) // {"name":"Paulo"} <- string
```

Environment variables can parse other environment variables
too. See the example above:

```dotenv
HOST=localhost
PORT=3000

APP_URL=http://${HOST}:${PORT}
```
```typescript
console.log(Env('APP_URL')) // "http://localhost:3000"
```

## Custom environment file path 

You can also change the name and the path of your `.env` file. 
To do that you need to set the new path to `Ignite::load()` static method:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('dev.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, {
  envPath: './bootstrap/.env.dev' ðŸ‘ˆ
})

await ignite.httpServer()
```

:::tip

Always remember that when using relative paths to set something
in Athenna, you need to use your project root path as reference,
just like in the example above.

:::

## Configuration files

All the configuration files for the Athenna framework are
stored in the `config` directory if you are using the 
default project template. Each option is documented, so 
feel free to look through the files and get familiar with 
the options available to you.

:::info

The slim template is configured to use `src/config` path 
instead. But the folder does not exist in the project by 
default. You can check how to change this path [in here](/docs/getting-started/configuration#define-my-own-configuration-path).

:::

Athenna needs almost no additional configuration out of
the box. You are free to get started developing! Each
option is documented, so feel free to look through the
files and get familiar with the options available to you.
It contains several options such as debug, environment and
locale that you may wish to change, according to your
application.

### Manipulating configuration values

You may easily access your configuration values using the
global `Config` helper class. The configuration values may
be accessed using `"dot (.)"` syntax, which includes the
name of the file and option you wish to access. Let's cover
some methods bellow:

#### `Config.get()`

The `get()` method will return the value of your configuration.
You can also set a default value as second parameter that will
be returned if the configuration option does not exist:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

const defaultValue = 'Athenna'
const name = Config.get('app.name', defaultValue)

console.log(name) // MyAppName
```

:::tip

You can get all the configuration values using `get()` method
without any key:

```typescript
console.log(Config.get()) // { app: {...}, http: {...}, ... }
```

:::

#### `Config.set()`

The `set()` method is very useful to set or change the value
of some configuration in runtime:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

Config.set('app.name', 'Athenna Framework')

console.log(Config.get('app.name')) // Athenna Framework
```

:::warning

The `Config.set()` method does not change the values in
the configuration file, only in runtime. To do that, you
will need to use the [Config.rewrite()](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/configuration#configrewrite)
method.

:::

#### `Config.safeSet()`

If you are not sure if some configuration value is already
set of not, you can use the `safeSet()` method instead to
not overwrite something that was already defined:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

console.log(Config.get('app.name')) // MyAppName

Config.safeSet('app.name', 'Athenna Framework')

console.log(Config.get('app.name')) // MyAppName
```

#### `Config.delete()`

The `delete()` method could be used to delete some configuration
value:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

Config.delete('app.name')

console.log(Config.get('app.name')) // undefined
```

:::warning

Just like `Config.set()` method, `Config.delete()` does
not change the values in the configuration file, only
in runtime. To do that you will need to use the
`Config.rewrite()` method.

:::

#### `Config.rewrite()`

The `rewrite()` method is very useful for rewriting the
configuration file. Very useful when you want to
programmatically modify the configuration file source code.
This method uses the [magicast](https://github.com/unjs/magicast)
library under the hood to do that:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

Config.set('app.name', 'Athenna Framework')

await Config.rewrite('app')
```

:::warning

Let's suppose that you want to set a function as a value,
you can use builders.functionCall function of [magicast](https://github.com/unjs/magicast)
library to do that:

```typescript
import { builders } from 'magicast'
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

Config.set('app.name', builders.functionCall('Env', ['MY_APP_NAME']))

await Config.rewrite('app')
```

The example above will produce the following code in `Path.config('app.ts')`:

```typescript
export default {
    name: Env('MY_APP_NAME')
    ...
}
```

:::

#### `Config.is()`

The `is()` method could be used to validate if your
configuration value matches some other value:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

if (Config.is('app.name', 'Athenna')) {
  // do something
}
```

You can set an array as second parameter to `is()` method.
If any value in the array matches the configuration value,
the method will return true:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

if (Config.is('app.name', ['Athenna', 'MyAppName'])) {
  // do something
}
```

:::tip

You can use the `isNot()` method to do the negated validation.

:::

#### `Config.existsAll()`

The `existsAll()` method could be used to validate if an
array of configuration keys exists or not:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

if (Config.existsAll(['app.name', 'app.version'])) {
  // do something
}
```

:::tip

You can use the `notExistsAll()` method to do the negate
validation.

:::

#### `Config.clear()`

The `clear()` method could be used to clear all the configuration
values:

```typescript
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

Config.clear()

console.log(Config.get()) // {}
```

#### `Config.load()`

The `load()` method could be used to load some configuration
file path:

```typescript
import { Path } from '@athenna/common'
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

await Config.load(Path.stubs('config/test.ts'))

console.log(Config.get('test')) // { ... }
```

#### `Config.safeLoad()`

The `safeLoad()` method will only load the file path if it
is not defined:

```typescript
import { Path } from '@athenna/common'
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

await Config.safeLoad(Path.stubs('config/app.js'))
```

#### `Config.loadAll()`

The `loadAll` method will load all files found inside some
configuration path:

```typescript
import { Path } from '@athenna/common'
import { Config } from '@athenna/config'

await Config.loadAll(Path.stubs('config'))
```

### Define my own configuration path

If you are using the [slim](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/installation#project-structure)
project structure, or you are building your own project
structure, you are not going to have the `config` directory
in your project root path.

You will have two options now:

1. If you are using the [slim](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/installation#project-structure)
project structure, you can create the `config` directory inside your `src` folder.
2. Specify to Athenna a different path to your `config` directory.

:::note

The [slim](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/installation#project-structure)
project structure is using the second option above to
specify to Athenna that the configuration files will
be inside of `src/config` directory. Check the examples
bellow to see how this implementation works.

:::

To specify your application directories to Athenna, you can
open the `.athennarc.json` file and add the `directories`
property to it. If you are using [slim](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/installation#project-structure)
project structure, you will already have this property
defined.

The `directories` property is an object that maps the directory
base path that the [`Path`](https://athenna.io/docs/digging-deeper/helpers#path)
helper will use to resolve your application paths:

```typescript
import { Path } from '@athenna/common'

console.log(Path.config()) // /path/to/your/project/config
```

All the `directories` key names follow the [`Path`](https://athenna.io/docs/digging-deeper/helpers#path)
class methods names. This means that if you want to change
what is returned by the `Path.config()` method, you will
need to add the `config` key to the `directories` object:

```json
{
  "directories": {
    "config": "src/config"
  }
}
```

Now when calling the `Path.config()` method, it will return
a different path:

```typescript
import { Path } from '@athenna/common'

console.log(Path.config()) // /path/to/your/project/src/config ðŸ‘ˆ
```

Athenna always rely on [`Path`](https://athenna.io/docs/digging-deeper/helpers#path)
class methods to find files and directories that are used
internally by the framework, like configuration file, route
files, entry points and many others.

Check [the directories property documentation section](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/athennarc-file#the-directories-property)
for more information about the `directories` property. And
check [the do your own structure documentation section](https://athenna.io/docs/getting-started/directory-structure#do-your-own-structure)
for more information about how to create your own project
structure.

## Safe loading configuration files

Athenna got multiple types of applications, while using the framework
you will notice that some times you could end up igniting your application
twice. Let's suppose you are using `./node artisan serve` command to start
your application, this command will first ignite your application by Artisan
and them by the HTTP server.

This is usually not a problem at all, but depending on how you have created
your environment it could become one. To avoid reloading configuration
files in these situations, you can set the `loadConfigSafe` option as `true`
in `Ignite::load()` static method:

```typescript title="Path.bootstrap('main.ts')"
import { Ignite } from '@athenna/core'

const ignite = await new Ignite().load(import.meta.url, {
  loadConfigSafe: true, ðŸ‘ˆ
})

await ignite.httpServer()
```

## Debug mode

The `debug` option in your `Path.config('app.ts')` configuration
file determines how much information about your application
is actually displayed to you and for who is going to consume
your application. By default, this option is set to respect
the value of the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable, which is
stored in your `.env` file.

For local development, you should set the `APP_DEBUG`
environment variable to `true`. In your production environment,
this value should always be `false`, if the variable is
set to `true` in production, you risk exposing sensitive
configuration values to your application's end users.
