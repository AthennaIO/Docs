## Introduction {#id-introduction}

All the configuration files for the Athenna framework are stored in the `config` directory. Each option is documented,
so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

These configuration files allow you to configure things like your database connection information, your filesystem
information to handle file uploads, as well as various other core configuration values.

## Environment configuration {#id-environment-configuration}

It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment where the application is running.
For example, you may wish to use a different storage driver locally than you do on your production server.

To make this a cinch, Athenna utilizes the `dotenv` Node.js library. In a fresh Athenna installation, the root directory
of your application will contain a `.env.example` file that defines many common environment variables. During the Athenna
installation process, this file will automatically be copied to `.env`.

Athenna default `.env` file contains some common configuration values that may differ based on whether your application
is running locally or on a production. These values are then retrieved from various Athenna configuration files within
the `config` directory using Athenna `Env` function.

If you are developing with a team, you may wish to continue including a `.env.example` file with your application. By
putting placeholder values in the example configuration file, other developers on your team can clearly see which
environment variables are needed to run your application.

:::tip

Any variable in your `.env` file can be overridden by external environment variables such as server-level or system-level
environment variables.

:::

:::danger

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application source control, since each developer/server using your application
could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder
gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

:::

### Determining the current environment {#id-determining-the-current-environment}

Before loading your application's environment variables, Athenna determines if either the `NODE_ENV` environment variable
has been externally provided or if the `--env` CLI argument has been specified. If so, Athenna will attempt to load an
`.env.${NODE_ENV}` file if it exists. If it does not exist, the default .env file will be loaded.

### Get an environment variable value {#id-get-an-environment-variable-value}

You can get environment variables using the `Env()` function. If `APP_NAME` cannot be found, the constant `appName` will
have the value `Athenna`:

```typescript
const defaultValue = 'Athenna'

const appName = Env('APP_NAME', defaultValue)
```

All variables in your `.env` files are always parsed as strings. But the `Env` function has an auto cast system to parse
it for you when you call the function to get the value:

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>.env</th>
        <th>Env()</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>"true"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(true)</td>
        <td>true</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"(false)"</td>
        <td>false</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>"10"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(10)</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"(10)"</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>{`{"name":"Paulo"}`}</td>
        <td>{`"{"name":"Paulo"}"`}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>{`({"name":"Paulo"})`}</td>
        <td>{`{ name: 'Paulo' }`}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>{`"({"name":"Paulo"})"`}</td>
        <td>{`{ name: 'Paulo' }`}</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

:::tip

Maybe you want to force that your environment variable have the parentheses chars `(your-value)` or `(true)`. For that,
the `Env` function has the third parameter called `autoCast` that by default is always true, but you can set as false, and
it will not cast the value for your.

```typescript
process.env.APP_DEBUG = '(true)'

const defaultValue = false
const autoCast = false

console.log(Env('APP_DEBUG', defaultValue, autoCast)) // '(true)'
```

:::

Environment variables can parse other environment variables too. See the example above:

```dotenv
HOST=localhost
PORT=1335

APP_DOMAIN=http://${HOST}:${PORT}
```

```typescript
console.log(Env('APP_DOMAIN')) // "http://localhost:1335"
```

### Get a configuration value {#id-get-a-configuration-value}

You may easily access your configuration values using the global `Config` helper class from anywhere in your application.
The configuration values may be accessed using `"dot (.)"` syntax, which includes the name of the file and option you
wish to access. A default value may also be specified and will be returned if the configuration option does not exist:

```typescript
console.log(Config.get('app.name', 'Athenna')) // MyAppName
```

:::tip

You can notice that `Config` helper class has a method called `load`. This method loads all the config values in memory.
So if you try to use `process.env.APP_NAME = 'NEW APP NAME'` and call `Config.get('app.name')`, it's still going to return
the old `APP_NAME` value. To solve this you can use `load` method to reload your configuration files in your application ecosystem.

:::

## Debug mode {#id-debug-mode}

The debug option in your config/app configuration file determines how much information about your application is actually
displayed to you and for who is going to consume your application. By default, this option is set to respect the value of
the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable, which is stored in your `.env` file.

For local development, you should set the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable to `true`. In your production and pipelines environment,
this value should always be `false`. If the variable is set to `true` in production, you risk exposing sensitive configuration
values to your application's end users.
