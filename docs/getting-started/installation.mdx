# Installation

How to install and set up your first Athenna project.

## Your first Athenna project

### Prerequisites

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). We
recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to do
that.

> [Click here to install nvm and get npm and Node.js
running on your machine.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

### Installing via package manager

We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with
Athenna. With that in mind, we developed a CLI to assist
in the creation of a new project.

```bash
npm install @athenna/cli -g
```

Then you can run this command to generate your project:

```bash
athenna new my-project-name
```

The installation process prompts for the following selections:

#### Application type

- `REST Api` application is ideal for creating a Http server
using REST architecture.
- `CLI` application is ideal for creating global CLI's to publish
in some registry like npm.

#### Project structure

The installation process will ask if you want to create your
project with a `slim` project structure. All the Athenna
packages implementation assumes that you are using the default 
project structure, but you will always be able to use your own 
and configure the packages to work with it.

## Running your application

To run your application you can simply use the node script in
your project root. Don't worry about this file for now, we'll
talk about it later.

In your project root, run the following command:

```bash
./node --watch artisan serve
```

- The `watch` flag is meant to watch the file system for
changes and restart your application automatically when
doing some change on it.
- The `serve` command will look up for your `bootstrap/main.js`
file to bootstrap your application with predefined configurations.
