allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the 
details.

Athenna strives to provide an amazing developer experience while 
providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, 
an expressive database abstraction layer, unit and e2e testing, 
and more.

Whether you are new to Node.js ecosystem or have years of experience, 
Athenna is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take 
your first steps as a developer or give you a boost as you take your 
expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what you build, make
sure to share it with us in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/JdEbBAKw6X).

## Why Athenna?

There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building 
a software using Node.js. However, we believe Athenna is the best choice for 
building modern microservices.

### A progressive framework

We like to call Athenna a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that 
Athenna grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into backend 
development, Athenna's vast library of documentation, guides, and video 
tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.

If you're a senior developer, Athenna gives you robust tools for dependency 
injection, unit and e2e testing, database abstracted layer and more. 
Athenna is fine-tuned for building professional applications and ready to 
handle enterprise work loads.

### A scalable framework

Athenna is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of 
Node.js and Athenna's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems 
like Redis, horizontal scaling with Athenna is a breeze. In fact, Athenna applications 
have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.

### An agnostic framework

Athenna is perpect for building modern software using microservices architecture. 
No matter what type of application you are creating, be it a REST API, a CLI, a Cron Job, 
Athenna has a reliable solution foundation for each occasion, the only thing you will
need to take care is how your application will communicate with the external world.

### A community framework

Athenna is not reinventing the whell, the framework combines the best packages 
in the Node.js ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer friendly 
framework. We are always seeking for talented developers like you to
help us by [contributing to the framework](https://github.com/athennaio) and 
make it even better.

## Your first Athenna project

### Prerequisites

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to do that.

> [Click here to install nvm and get npm and Node.js
running on your machine.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

After you install `nvm`, we recommend you to install
Node.js v20.x or above, this is the current version that
the project is being developed, but you can still use
Node.js v16.x and above. Install Node.js v20.x by running:

```bash
nvm install 20
```

We recommend setting Node.js v20.x as the default version, to do
so with `nvm` run:

```bash
nvm alias default 20.8.1
```

### Installing via package manager

We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with
Athenna. With that in mind, we developed a CLI to assist
in the creation of a new project.

```bash
npm install -g @athenna/cli
```

Then you can run this command to generate your project:

```bash
athenna new my-project-name
```

The installation process prompts for the following selections:

#### Application type

- `REST Api` application is ideal for creating a Http server
using REST architecture.
- `CLI` application is ideal for creating global CLI's to publish
in some registry like npm.

#### Project structure

The installation process will ask if you want to create your
project with a `slim` project structure. All the Athenna
packages implementation assumes that you are using the default 
project structure, but you will always be able to use your own 
and configure the packages to work with it.

## Running your application

To run your application in development mode,
run the following command:

```bash
node artisan serve --watch
```

- The `serve` command will look up for your `Path.bootstrap('main.ts')`
file to bootstrap your application with predefined configurations.
- The `watch` flag is meant to watch the file system for
changes and restart your application automatically when
doing some change on it.

### What the ðŸ¤¬ is `Path.boostrap('main.ts')`?

Well, Athenna tries a lot to be a framework without opinion, one thing
that some frameworks do that makes them to have a lot of opinion is defining
crucial file paths where you can't touch that file without breaking everything.

Athenna is not totally different from them in this aspect, as you can see,
the `node artisan serve` command depends on the existence of the `./bootstrap/main.ts`
file. To be able to be "opinion less" without losing DX (Developer Experience) 
we ensure that you can easily configure this path the way you want by doing two 
things:

1. In all places of our documentation you will see that we always use the [`Path`](/docs/the-basics/helpers#path)
helper to reference file paths, so your brain could detect that the directory path 
you just see is configurable.
2. Inside `.athennarc.json` file or the `athenna` property of your `package.json` you 
have the [`directories` property](/docs/getting-started/athennarc-file#the-directories-property) 
where you can modify any path supported by the [`Path`](/docs/the-basics/helpers#path) helper.

Ok, now you might be asking yourself: what the ðŸ¤¬ is `.athennarc.json`? Be patient, we
gonna see later on this documentation page ðŸ˜†.

## Initial configuration

All of the configuration files for the Athenna framework are stored 
in the `Path.config()` directory. Each option is documented, so feel 
free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available 
to you.

Athenna needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are 
free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the 
`Path.config('app.ts')` file and its documentation. It contains several 
options such as timezone and locale that you may wish to change according 
to your application.

## Environment based configuration

Since many of Athenna's configuration option values may vary depending on 
whether your application is running on your local machine or in production, 
many important configuration values are defined using the `.env` file that 
exists at the root of your application.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, 
since each developer / server using your application could require a different 
environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the 
event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any 
sensitive credentials would get exposed.

:::note

For more information about the `.env` file and environment based configuration, 
check out the full [configuration documentation](/docs/getting-started/configuration).

:::

## Workspace and runtime configurations

Inside the root directory of your project, there is a file
called `.athennarc.json` or the `athenna` property of your 
`package.json`. These configurations are used by Athenna 
for configuring the workspace and certain runtime 
settings of your Athenna application. Basically any configuration 
related to how the framework will bootstrap and behave should be 
defined in these configuration. 

:::note

Always remember that if you can't find the `.athennarc.json` file
in the root path of you project, it will be defined inside of your
`package.json` in the `athenna` property. 

For more information about the RC file, more details about each one
of its options and also how to define your own properties inside of it 
check out the full [Athenna RC file documentation](/docs/getting-started/athennarc-file).
