## Why Athenna?

There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building 
a software using Node.js. However, we believe Athenna is the best choice for 
building modern microservices.

### A progressive framework

We like to call Athenna a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that 
Athenna grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into backend 
development, Athenna's vast library of documentation, guides, and video 
tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.

If you're a senior developer, Athenna gives you robust tools for dependency 
injection, unit and e2e testing, database abstracted layer and more. 
Athenna is fine-tuned for building professional applications and ready to 
handle enterprise work loads.

### A scalable framework

Athenna is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of 
Node.js and great libraries like [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/), horizontal 
scaling with Athenna is a breeze. In fact, Athenna REST API's have been 
easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.

### An agnostic framework

Athenna is perfect for building modern software using microservices architecture. 
No matter what type of application you are creating, be it a REST API, a CLI, a CRON Job, 
Athenna has a reliable solution foundation for each occasion, the only thing you will
need to take care is how your application will communicate with the external world.

### A community framework

Athenna is not reinventing the wheel, the framework combines the best packages 
in the Node.js ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer friendly 
framework. We are always seeking for talented developers like you to
help us by [contributing to the framework](https://github.com/athennaio) and 
make it even better.

## Your first Athenna project

### Prerequisites

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to do that.

> [Click here to install nvm and get npm and Node.js
running on your machine.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

After you install `nvm`, we recommend you to install
Node.js v20.x or above, but you can still use
Node.js v16.x and above. Install Node.js v20.x by running:

```bash
nvm install 20
```

We recommend setting Node.js v20.x as the default version, to do
so with `nvm` run:

```bash
nvm alias default 20.8.1
```

### Installing via package manager

We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with
Athenna. With that in mind, we developed a CLI to assist
in the creation of a new project.

```bash
npm install -g @athenna/cli
```

Then you can run this command to generate your project:

```bash
athenna new my-project-name
```

The installation process prompts for the following selections:

#### Application type

- `REST Api` application is ideal for creating a Http server
using REST architecture.
- `CLI` application is ideal for creating global CLI's to publish
in some registry like npm.
- `CRON` application is ideal for creating schedulers that will run
periodic jobs, such as for maintenance or calling third-party APIs
to collect up-to-date data.
- `WEB EDGE` application is ideal for creating full-stack applications 
using [Edge.js](https://edgejs.dev/docs/introduction) as template engine 
to serve static HTML from the server.
- `WEB REACT` application is ideal for creating full-stack applications using
[React](https://react.dev/).
- `WEB REACT SSR` application is ideal for creating full-stack applications using
[React](https://react.dev/) applying [SSR (Server Side Rendering)](https://www.sanity.io/glossary/server-side-rendering) 
techniques for faster page loads and to allow search engines to crawl your 
pages for [SEO (Search Engine Optimization)(https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo) 
purposes.

## Running your application

To run your application in development mode, run the following 
command:

```bash
node artisan serve --watch
```

- The `serve` command will look up for your <Path father="bin" child="main.ts" /> 
file to bootstrap your application with predefined configurations.
- The `watch` flag is meant to watch the file system for
changes and restart your application automatically when
doing some change on it.

### What the ðŸ¤¬ is `Path.bin('main.ts')`?

Well, Athenna tries a lot to be a framework without opinion, one thing
that some frameworks do that makes them to have a lot of opinion is defining
crucial file paths where you can't touch that file without breaking everything.

Athenna is not totally different from them in this aspect, as you can see,
the `node artisan serve` command depends on the existence of the `./bin/main.ts`
file. To be able to be "opinion less" without losing DX (Developer Experience) 
we ensure that you can easily configure this path the way you want by doing two 
things:

1. In all places of our documentation you will see that we always use the 
[`Path`](/docs/the-basics/helpers#path) helper to reference file paths, this
way is easier for you to understand that the path directory you just see is 
configurable.
2. Inside `.athennarc.json` file or the `athenna` property of your `package.json` you 
have the [`directories` property](/docs/getting-started/athennarc-file#the-directories-property) 
where you can modify any path supported by the [`Path`](/docs/the-basics/helpers#path) helper.

Ok, now you might be asking yourself: what the ðŸ¤¬ is `.athennarc.json`? Be patient, we
gonna see later on this documentation page ðŸ˜†.

## Initial configuration

All of the configuration files for the Athenna framework are stored 
in the <Path father="config" /> directory. Each option is documented, so feel 
free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available 
to you.

Athenna needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are 
free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the 
<Path father="config" child="app.ts" /> file and its documentation. It contains several 
options such as locale that you may wish to change according to your 
application.

## Environment based configuration

Since many of Athenna's configuration option values may vary depending on 
whether your application is running on your local machine or in production, 
many important configuration values are defined using the `.env` file that 
exists at the root of your application.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, 
since each developer / server using your application could require a different 
environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the 
event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any 
sensitive credentials would get exposed.

:::note

For more information about the `.env` file and environment based configuration, 
check out the full [configuration documentation](/docs/getting-started/configuration).

:::

## Workspace and runtime configurations

Inside the root directory of your project, there is a file
called `.athennarc.json` or the `athenna` property of your 
`package.json`. These configurations are used by Athenna 
for configuring the workspace and certain runtime 
settings of your Athenna application. Basically any configuration 
related to how the framework will bootstrap and behave should be 
defined in these configuration. 

:::note

Always remember that if you can't find the `.athennarc.json` file
in the root path of you project, it will be defined inside of your
`package.json` in the `athenna` property. 

For more information about the RC file, more details about each one
of its options and also how to define your own properties inside of it 
check out the full [Athenna RC file documentation](/docs/getting-started/athennarc-file).

## Next steps

Now that you have created your Athenna project, you may be 
wondering what to learn next. First, we strongly recommend 
becoming familiar with how Athenna works by reading the 
following documentation:

- [Application lifecycle](/docs/architecture-concepts/application-lifecycle)
- [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration)
- [Directory structure](/docs/getting-started/directory-structure)
- [Service container](/docs/architecture-concepts/service-container)
- [Facades](/docs/architecture-concepts/facades)

How you want to use Athenna will also dictate the next steps 
on your journey. Since Athenna has different kind of applications, 
there are a variety of ways to use Athenna, and we'll explore 
the available ones bellow.

### REST API application

Use the REST API Application to serve as an API backend to single page application
or mobile apps. In this context you may use Athenna for data storage / retrieval 
for your REST API, while also taking advantage of Athenna's powerful services such 
as database, emails, notifications, and more.

If this is how you plan to use Athenna, you may want to check out our documentation 
on [routing](/docs/rest-api-application/routing) and the [ORM](/docs/orm/getting-started).

### Command Line Interface (CLI) application

Use the command line interface (CLI) application to create libraries like `athenna`
for NPM where other developers could install it in their terminal. In this context
you may use Athenna for automating process or generating files, while also taking 
advantage of all Athenna's powerful foundation.

If this is how you plan to use Athenna, you may want to check out our documentation
on [commands](/docs/cli-application/commands).

### CRON Job application

Use the CRON Job application to create schedulers for running periodic jobs, such 
as for maintenance or calling third-party APIs to collect up-to-date data.

If this is how you plan to use Athenna, you may want to check out our documentation
on [schedulers](/docs/cron-application/schedulers).

### Web application 

Create full-stack web applications powered by Vite. You can choose to use a simple 
template engine to generate static HTML on the server or use the right plugins to
use frameworks like React.

If this is how you plan to use Athenna, you may want to check out our documentation
on [web application](/docs/rest-api-application/web-application).
