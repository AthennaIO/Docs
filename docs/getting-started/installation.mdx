## Your first Athenna project {#id-your-first-athenna-project}

### Prerequisites {#id-prerequisites}
Before scaffolding a new Athenna project, first you need to install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/).
We recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to do that.

> [Click here to install nvm and get npm and Node.js running on your machine](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

### Installing via package manager {#id-installing-via-package-manager}

We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Athenna. With that in mind, we developed a CLI to assist in
the creation of a new project, as well as the installation of new components.

```shell
npm install -g @athenna/cli
```

Then you can run one of these commands to generate your project:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="http" label="http" default>

        ```shell
        athenna new my-project-name
        ```
        ```shell
        athenna new my-project-name --type http
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="cli">

        ```shell
        athenna new my-project-name --type cli
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initial configuration {#id-initial-configuration}

All the configuration files for the Athenna framework are stored in the `config` directory. Each option is documented,
so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

Athenna needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you
may wish to review the `config/app.js` file and its documentation. It contains several options such as `debug`, `environment`
and `locale` that you may wish to change according to your application.

### Environment configuration {#id-environment-configuration}

Many of Athenna configuration options values depends on whether your application is running, on your local machine or
on a production server. Many important configuration values are defined using the `.env` file that exists at the root
of your application.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer/server using your
application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event
an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

:::tip

For more information about the `.env` file and environment configuration, check out the full [configuration documentation](configuration).

:::

### Directory/Language configuration {#id-directory-language-configuration}

By default, Athenna uses the modern EcmaScript modules. When you run the `npm start` command, the Artisan will always
read your `bootstrap/main.js` file to start your application.

You can run your application using `npm run start:dev` to run in watch mode. The `npm test` command will always look
for your `tests/main.js` file to run your tests.

:::info

The `npm run start:dev` command runs with [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to hot reload your application. And
the `npm test` commands uses [`japa.dev`](https://japa.dev/) test runner to run your tests.
