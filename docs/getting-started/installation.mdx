## Your first Athenna project {#id-your-first-athenna-project}

### Prerequisites {#id-prerequisites}
Before scaffolding a new Athenna project, first you need to install Node.js and NPM.
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to do that.

> [Click here to install nvm and get npm and Node.js running on your machine](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

### Installing via package manager {#id-installing-via-package-manager}

We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Athenna. With that in mind, we developed a CLI to assist in
the creation of a new project, as well as the creation and installation of new components.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```shell
npm install -g @athenna/cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" default>

```shell
yarn global add @athenna/cli
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then you can run this command to generate your project:

```shell
athenna new project my-project-name
```

## Initial configuration {#id-initial-configuration}

All the configuration files for the Athenna framework are stored in the `config` directory. Each option is documented,
so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

Athenna needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you
may wish to review the `config/app` file and its documentation. It contains several options such as `timezone` and
`locale` that you may wish to change according to your application.

### Environment configuration {#id-environment-configuration}

Many of Athenna configuration options values depends on whether your application is running, on your local machine or
on a production server. Many important configuration values are defined using the `.env` file that exists at the root
of your application.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer/server using your
application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event
an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

:::tip

For more information about the `.env` file and environment configuration, check out the full [configuration documentation](configuration).

### Directory/Language configuration {#id-directory-language-configuration}

By default, Athenna use TypeScript for development. But when you run the development and the production application,
the @athenna/cli first compiles all the application and create the `build` folder to run your code using JavaScript.

You can run Athenna using `ts-node` to run the application without the build process. Briefly, running the application
with TypeScript code instead of JavaScript. To get this working you need to set the environment variable `NODE_TS=true`
in the startup of your application. You can check the script `"test"` in your `package.json` file to get an example
