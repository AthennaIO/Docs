## Introduction {#id-introduction}

:::info

We highly recommend using the Athenna `athenna make` command to generate the files of your application. If using the CLI,
it will automatically generate the file and add the type to the `providers/Container` file. We are going to see how this
guy work forward in the [providers' folder section](#id-the-providers-directory).

:::

## The root directory {#id-the-root-directory}

### The app directory {#id-the-app-directory}

The `app` directory contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this directory in more detail soon. Almost
all the classes in your application will be in this directory.

### The bootstrap directory {#id-the-bootstrap-directory}

The `bootstrap` directory, contains all of your application's bootstrap files. It's here that Athenna holds the `main`
file that bootstrap the application using the `Ignite` class.

### The config directory {#id-the-config-directory}

The `config` directory, contains all of your application's configuration files. It's a great idea to read through all
of these files and familiarize yourself with all the options available to you.

### The database directory {#id-the-resources-directory}

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `athenna install database` command.
The `database` directory contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds. If you wish, you may also use
this directory to hold an SQLite database.

### The lang directory {#id-the-lang-directory}

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `athenna install intl` command.
The `lang` directory houses all of your application's language files.

### The providers directory {#id-the-providers-directory}

The `providers` directory contains all the service providers for your application. Service providers bootstrap your
application by binding services in the service container, registering events, or performing any other tasks to
prepare your application to run.

Inside this directory we also have the `Container` file. This file is just a type that defines the type that exists
inside the container. Very useful to use inside other providers constructor such as `Services`. See the example above:

```typescript
import { Container } from 'providers/Container'
import { MyAppService } from 'app/Utils/MyAppService'

export class UserService {
  private myAppService: MyAppService

  /**
   * Create a new controller instance.
   *
   * @param container
   * @return WelcomeController
   */
  public constructor(container: Container) {
      // container.myAppService is from MyAppService type
      this.myAppService = container.myAppService
  }

  /**
   * Find one user by id.
   *
   * @param id
   */
  async findOne(id: string) {
      return { id }
  }
}
```

### The routes directory {#id-the-routes-directory}

The `routes` directory contains all the route definitions for your application. By default, several route files are
included with Athenna: `http`.

The `http` file is where you will define the entrypoint of your api using the `Route` class that is provided by the
`HttpRouteProvider`.

### The storage directory {#id-the-storage-directory}

The `storage` directory contains your logs, file caches, files uploaded locally and other files generated by the
framework. This directory is segregated into `app`, `framework`, and `logs` directories. The `app` directory
may be used to store any files generated by your application. The `framework` directory is used to store framework
generated files and caches and the `logs` directory contains your application's log files.

### The tests directory {#id-the-tests-directory}

The `tests` directory contains your unitary and E2E tests. Example [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit tests and feature
tests are provided out of the box. Each test class should be suffixed with the word `Test`. You may run your tests using
the `jest` or `npm run test` commands.

## The app directory {#id-the-main-app-directory}

The majority of your application is housed in the `app` directory.

The `app` directory contains a variety of additional directories such as Http. Think of the `Http` directory as providing
an API into the core of your application. The HTTP protocol is a mechanism to interact with your application, but do
not actually contain application logic. In other words, it's a way of issuing commands to your application. The `Http`
directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests.

A variety of other directories will be generated inside the `app` directory as you use the `athenna make` commands to
generate classes. So, for example, you can generate a new model inside `app/Models` directory executing the
`athenna make:model` command to generate a model class.

:::tip

Many of the classes in the `app` directory can be generated via `athenna` commands. To review the available commands,
run the `athenna list make` command in your terminal.

:::

### The Http directory {#id-the-Http-directory}

This directory does not exist by default if you have not created your project in CLI using the project type `http`, but
you can create it if you execute the `athenna install http` command. The `Http` directory contains your controllers and
middlewares. Almost all the logic to handle http requests entering your application will be placed in this directory.

### The Models directory {#id-the-Models-directory}

:::caution

The `Models` directory will not come installed with the framework and the `athenna make:model` will not work until you
run `athenna install database` command to set up `@athenna/orm` and `@athenna/database` packages in your project

:::

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `athenna make:model` command.
The `Models` directory contains all of your ORM model classes. The ORM included with Athenna provides beautiful and
simple methods for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact
with that table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.

### The Repositories directory {#id-the-Repositories-directory}

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `athenna make:repository` command.
The `Repositories` directory contains all the classes that retrieve data from somewhere. It can be a SQL, NoSQL Database
or an ElasticSearch. Usually you are going to use the ORM with these classes to get your data and treat it before returning

### The Resources directory {#id-the-Resources-directory}

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `athenna make:resource` command.
The `Resources` directory contains all the classes that will be responsible to transform your ORM models to a simples Object.
For example, you may wish to display certain attributes for a subset of users and not for others.

### The Services directory {#id-the-Services-directory}

The `Services` directory contains the business logic of your application. The entrypoint of your application should have
only the logic responsible to receive the request, delegate to your service and return what service return. Every file in
`Services` will be registered inside the `Ioc container` by the `ServicesProvider` class. This way you can easily use this
services inside your controllers using the `constructor` method in camelCase format, example: the class name is `UserService`
but in the `constructor` you call the `userService`. You can explore the container in more detail in the
[container architecture concepts section](/docs/architecture-concepts/container).

:::tip

Remember, we highly recommend using the Athenna `athenna make:service` command to generate your services. If using the CLI,
it will automatically generate the file and add the type to the `providers/Container` file.

:::

### The Validators directory {#id-the-Validators-directory}

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `athenna make:validator` command.
The Validators directory contains the custom validation objects for your application. Validators are used to encapsulate
complicated validation logic in a simple object.
