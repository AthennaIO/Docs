## Introduction {#id-introduction}

:::info

We highly recommend using the `node artisan make` command to generate the files of your application. If using the Artisan,
it will automatically generate the file and register it wherever is needed. Take as an example the `node artisan make:command`
command. First it will generate the file and then will register the command inside the `commands` array property of
`app/Console/Kernel.js` file.

:::

## The root directory {#id-the-root-directory}

### The app directory {#id-the-app-directory}

The `app` directory contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this directory in more detail soon. Almost
all the classes in your application will be in this directory.

### The bootstrap directory {#id-the-bootstrap-directory}

The `bootstrap` directory, contains all of your application's bootstrap files. It's here that Athenna holds the `main`
file that bootstrap the application using the `Ignite` class.

### The config directory {#id-the-config-directory}

The `config` directory, contains all of your application's configuration files. It's a great idea to read through all
of these files and familiarize yourself with all the options available to you.

### The database directory {#id-the-resources-directory}

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `athenna install:database` command.
The `database` directory contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds. If you wish, you may also use
this directory to hold an SQLite database.

### The providers directory {#id-the-providers-directory}

The `providers` directory contains all the service providers for your application. Service providers bootstrap your
application by binding services in the service container, registering events, or performing any other tasks to
prepare your application to run.

Inside this directory we also have the `Container` file. This file is just a type that defines the type that exists
inside the container. Very useful to use inside other providers' constructor such as `Services`. See the example above:

```javascript
export class UserService {
  /**
   * @type {import('#app/Services/MyAppService').MyAppService}
   */
  #myAppService

  /**
   * Create a new controller instance.
   *
   * @param {any} myAppService
   */
  constructor(myAppService) {
    this.#myAppService = myAppService
  }

  /**
   * Find one user by id.
   *
   * @param {string} id
   */
  async findOne(id) {
    return this.#myAppService.findOne(id)
  }
}
```

### The routes directory {#id-the-routes-directory}

The `routes` directory contains all the route definitions for your application. By default, several route files are
included with Athenna: `http`, `console`.

The `http` file is where you will define the entrypoint of your api using the `Route` facade that is provided by the
`HttpRouteProvider`.

The `console` file is where you will define the entrypoint of your commands using the `Artisan` facade that is provided
by the `ArtisanProvider`.

### The storage directory {#id-the-storage-directory}

The `storage` directory contains your logs, file caches, files uploaded locally and other files generated by the
framework. This directory is segregated into `app`, `framework`, and `logs` directories. The `app` directory
may be used to store any files generated by your application. The `framework` directory is used to store framework
generated files and caches and the `logs` directory contains your application's log files.

### The tests directory {#id-the-tests-directory}

You can create a test executing the `node artisan make:test` command. The `tests` directory contains your unitary and E2E
tests. [Japa](https://japa.dev/) unit tests and feature tests are provided out of the box. Each test class should be suffixed
with the word `Test`. You may run your tests using the `npm test` command.

## The app directory {#id-the-main-app-directory}

The majority of your application is housed in the `app` directory.

The `app` directory contains a variety of additional directories such as Http. Think of the `Http` directory as providing
an API into the core of your application. The HTTP protocol is a mechanism to interact with your application, but do
not actually contain application logic. In other words, it's a way of issuing commands to your application. The `Http`
directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests.

A variety of other directories will be generated inside the `app` directory as you use the `node artisan make` commands
to generate classes. So, for example, you can generate a new model inside `App/Models` directory executing the
`node artisan make:model` command to generate a model class.

:::tip

Many of the classes in the `app` directory can be generated via `artisan make` commands. To review the available commands,
run the `node artisan list make` command in your terminal.

:::

### The Console directory {#id-the-Console-directory}

The `Console` directory contains all the custom Artisan commands for your application. These commands may be generated
using the `make:command` command. This directory also houses your console kernel, which is where your custom Artisan 
commands are registered.

### The Http directory {#id-the-Http-directory}

The `Http` directory contains your controllers and middlewares. Almost all the logic to handle http requests entering your
application will be placed in this directory.

### The Models directory {#id-the-Models-directory}

:::caution

The `Models` directory will not come installed with the framework and the `node artisan make:model` will not work until you
run `athenna install:database` command to set up `@athenna/database` package in your project.

:::

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `node artisan make:model` command.
The `Models` directory contains all of your ORM model classes. The ORM included with Athenna provides beautiful and
simple methods for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact
with that table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.

### The Repositories directory {#id-the-Repositories-directory}

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `node artisan make:repository` command.
The `Repositories` directory contains all the classes that retrieve data from somewhere. It can be a SQL, NoSQL Database
or an ElasticSearch. Usually you are going to use the ORM with these classes to get your data and treat it before returning

### The Resources directory {#id-the-Resources-directory}

:::caution

The `Resources` directory will not come installed with the framework and the `node artisan make:resource` will not work until you
run `athenna install:database` command to set up `@athenna/database` package in your project.

:::

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `node artisan make:resource` command.
The `Resources` directory contains all the classes that will be responsible to transform your ORM models to a simple Object.
For example, you may wish to display certain attributes for a subset of users and not for others.

### The Services directory {#id-the-Services-directory}

The `Services` directory contains the business logic of your application. The entrypoint of your application should have
only the logic responsible to receive the request, delegate to your service and return what service return. Every file in
`Services` will be registered inside the `Ioc container` by the `ServiceProvider` class. This way you can easily use this
services inside your entrypoint classes like controllers using the `constructor` method in camelCase format, example: the
class name is `UserService` but in the `constructor` you call the `userService`. You can explore the container in more detail in the
[container architecture concepts section](/docs/architecture-concepts/container).
