# Database: Migrations 

See how to create and run database migrations in Athenna Framework.

## Introduction

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your
team to define and share the application's database schema
definition. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a
column to their local database schema after pulling in your changes
from source control, you've faced the problem that database migrations
solve.

## Generating migrations

You may use the `make:migration` Artisan command to generate a database migration. The new migration will be placed in your
<Path father="migrations" />  directory. Each migration filename contains a
timestamp that allows Athenna to determine the order of
the migrations:

```bash
node artisan make:migration FlightsMigration 
```

:::tip

Migrations templates may be customized using the
[**template customization command**](https://athenna.io/docs/the-basics/cli/commands#registering-custom-templates).

## Migration structure

A migration class contains two methods: `up()` and `down()`. The `up()`
method is used to add new tables, columns, or indexes to your
database, while the `down()` method should reverse the operations
performed by the `up()` method.

Within both of these methods, you may use the [`knex schema builder`](https://knexjs.org/guide/schema-builder.html) to
expressively create and modify tables. For example, the following migration creates a `flights` table:

```typescript
import { BaseMigration, type DatabaseImpl } from '@athenna/database'

export class FlightsMigration extends BaseMigration {
  public tableName = 'flights'

  public async up(db: DatabaseImpl) {
    return db.createTable(this.tableName, (table) => {
      table.increments('id')
      table.string('name')
      table.string('airline')
      table.timestamps(true, true, true)
    })
  }

  public async down({ schema }: DatabaseImpl) {
    return db.dropTableIfExists(this.tableName)
  }
}
```

### Setting the migration connection

If your migration will be interacting with a database connection 
other than your application's default database connection,
you should set the static getter `connection` in your migration:

```typescript
import { BaseMigration, type DatabaseImpl } from '@athenna/database'

export class FlightsMigration extends BaseMigration { 
  public static connection() {
    return 'postgres'
  }

  public async up(db: DatabaseImpl) {
    // ...
  }

  public async down(db: DatabaseImpl) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Running migrations 

To run all of your outstanding migrations, execute the 
`migration:run` Artisan command:

```bash
node artisan migration:run
```

You can use the `--connection` option to run migrations 
for a specific connection:

```bash
node artisan migration:run --connection=postgres
```

:::warning

If `postgres` is your default connection then all the migrations 
using the `default` value in the static `connection()` method
will run too.

:::

## Reverting

To revert all your migrations, you may use the `migration:revert` 
Artisan command. This command will revert all your migrations:

```bash
node artisan migration:revert
```

You can use the `--connection` option to revert migrations for a 
specific connection:

```bash
node artisan migration:revert --connection=postgres
```

:::warning

If `postgres` is your default connection than all the migrations 
using the `default` value in the static `connection()` method
will be reverted too.
