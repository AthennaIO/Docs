# Database: Seeding

See how to create and run database seeders. 

## Introduction

Athenna includes the ability to seed your database with data using 
seed classes. All seed classes are stored in the `Path.seeders()` 
directory.

## Writing seeders 

To generate a seeder, execute the `make:seeder` Artisan command. All 
seeders generated by the framework will be placed in the `Path.seeders()` 
directory:

```shell
node artisan make:seeder UserSeeder
```

A seeder class only contains one method by default: `run()`. This method 
is called when the `db:seed` Artisan command is executed. Within the 
`run()` method, you may insert data into your database however you wish. 
You may use the query builder to manually insert data, or you may use 
[the model factories](/docs/orm/getting-started):

```typescript
import { User } from '#app/models/user'
import { BaseSeeder, type DatabaseImpl } from '@athenna/database'

export class UserSeeder extends BaseSeeder { 
  public async run(db: DatabaseImpl) {
    await db.table('users').createMany([/*.....*/])

    await User.factory().count(20).create()
  }
}
```

## Running seeders

You may execute the `db:seed` Artisan command to seed your database. 
By default, the `db:seed` command will run all the seeders
inside the `Path.seeders()` folder, but you can run only one seeder 
using the `--classes` argument:

```shell
node artisan db:seed

node artisan db:seed --classes=UserSeeder
```

### Setting the seeder connection

If your seeder will be interacting with a database connection other 
than your application's default database connection, you should set 
the static method `connection()` in your seeder:

```typescript
import { BaseSeeder, type DatabaseImpl } from '@athenna/database'

export class UserSeeder extends BaseSeeder { 
  public static connection() {
    return 'postgres'
  }

  public async run(db: DatabaseImpl) {
    await Database.table('users').createMany([/*.....*/])

    await User.factory().count(20).create()
  }
}
```
