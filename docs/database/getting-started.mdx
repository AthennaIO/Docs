# Database: Getting Started 

See how to create database connections in Athenna Framework.

## Introduction

Almost every modern application interacts with a 
database. Athenna makes interacting with databases 
extremely simple across a variety of supported databases 
using a fluent query builder and the ORM.

## Installation

First of all you need to install `@athenna/database` package
and configure it. Artisan provides a very simple command to 
install and configure the database library in your project. 
Simply run the following:

```bash
node artisan install @athenna/database
```

The database configurer will do the following operations in 
your project:

- Ask you for the default database you want to use. (`mongo`, `mysql`, `sqlite` or `postgres`).
- Create the `database.ts` configuration file.
- Add all database providers in your `.athennarc.json` file.
- Add all database commands in your `.athennarc.json` file.
- Add all database template files in your `.athennarc.json` file.
- Add database environment variables to `.env`, `.env.test` and `.env.example`.
- Configure the `docker-compose.yml` file according to the database selected.
- Install libraries like `knex` and `pg`. It will always depends on the default 
database you selected.

## Configuration

All the configuration options for your application's database 
behavior is housed in the `Path.config('database.ts')` 
configuration file. This file allows you to configure your 
application's database connections, so be sure to review each 
of the available connections and their options. We'll review 
a few common options below.

### Available connection drivers

Each database connection is powered by a "driver". The driver 
determines how and where the data is actually transported.
The following database connection drivers are available in 
every Athenna application. An entry for most of these drivers 
is already present in your application's `Path.config('database.ts')` 
configuration file, so be sure to review this file to become
familiar with its contents:

| Driver name |             Website              |                                           Built with |
|:------------|:--------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------:|
| `mongo`     |     https://www.mongodb.com/     |   [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) |
| `mysql`     |      https://www.mysql.com/      |           [knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) |
| `sqlite`    |     https://www.sqlite.org/      |           [knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) |
| `postgres`  |   https://www.postgresql.org/    |           [knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) |

:::note

Athenna has another driver called `fake` that is very helpful when running tests.
The `fake` driver got the same signature of all other drivers, but it returns
empty objects and arrays in executors methods like `find()`, which is perfect to use
within the [`Mock`](/docs/testing/mocking) class. For more information
about the `FakeDriver`, take a look at the
[mocking database documentation section.](/docs/testing/mocking#mocking-database)

:::

### Overview of some environment variables

After installing the database component using the Athenna CLI you 
can check your `.env` file in your project root path, the Athenna 
CLI have added some environment variables there to help you connect 
to your database. These variables are:

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=postgres
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DEBUG=false
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_DATABASE=database
```

Let's focus on **DB_CONNECTION and DB_DEBUG** variables:

#### DB_CONNECTION

This variable specify for Athenna what is the default connection name 
that should be used by `Database` facade when running database operations.

#### DB_DEBUG

This variable is useful when running your application locally, If 
`DB_DEBUG` is `true`, then you will be able to see all the queries
being executed in your database.

:::tip

Before going through the documentation, remember to run 
[`docker-compose up -d`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to 
start up the database in your machine.

:::

## Database operations

Once you have configured your database connection, you may communicate 
with it using the `Database` facade. The `Database` facade provides a 
lot of methods to perform database operations such as **creating, 
dropping and listing databases/tables, running and reverting** 
[**migrations**](/docs/database/migrations)**,** 
[**transactions**](/docs/database/getting-started#database-transactions)**,
queries, connecting to new databases and also closing these 
connections.**

### Creating and dropping databases

```typescript
import { Database } from '@athenna/database'

await Database.createDatabase('hello')
await Database.dropDatabase('hello')
```

You can also get all databases names as string and check if some 
database name exists:

```typescript
const databases = await Database.getDatabases() // ['postgres']
const current = await Database.getCurrentDatabase() // 'postgres'

await Database.hasDatabase('postgres') // true
await Database.hasDatabase('not-found') // false
```

### Creating and dropping tables

```typescript
import { Database } from '@athenna/database'

await Database.createTable('products', table => {
  table.increments('id').primary()
})

await Database.dropTable('products')
```

You can also get all tables names as string and check if some 
table name exists:

```typescript
const tables = await Database.getTables() // ['users']

await Database.hasTable('users') // true
await Database.hasTable('not-found') // false
```

### Running and reverting migrations

If you don't know what is a migration you can 
check [`clicking here`](/docs/database/migrations)

```typescript
await Database.runMigrations()
await Database.revertMigrations()
```

### Transactions

If you don't know what is a transaction you can 
check [`clicking here`](/docs/database/getting-started#database-transactions)

```typescript
import { Log } from '@athenna/logger'

const trx = await Database.startTransaction()
const query = trx.table('users')

const users = [] // Imagine a lot of users to be inserted here...

try {
    await query.createMany(users)

    await trx.commitTransaction()
} catch (error) {
    // If some user in the "users" array has been created,
    // it will be removed if one fails to insert.
    await trx.rollbackTransaction()

    Log.error('Failed to create one of the users. Original error: %s', JSON.stringify(error))
}
```

## Running queries

You may use the `table()` method provided by the `Database` facade 
to begin a query. The `table()` method returns a fluent query 
builder instance for the given table, allowing you to chain more 
constraints onto the query and then finally retrieve the results of 
the query using one of the **executors** methods. These are the most 
relevant methods:

- `find()` 
- `findMany()` 
- `create()`
- `createMany()`
- `update()`
- `delete()`

Everytime that you use the `Database` facade you are using a different 
instance of `DatabaseImpl` class. This means that you would need to 
call `table()` method everytime for different queries. To get around 
this, you can save the instance in a local
variable:

```typescript
import { Database } from '@athenna/database'

const userQuery = Database.table('users') // First instance of QueryBuilder
const orderQuery = Database.table('orders') // Second instance of QueryBuilder
const productsQuery = Database.table('products') // Third instance of QueryBuilder
```

#### Running a find query

The `find()` method is useful to retrieve only one record that match 
the query statements from database:

```typescript
const query = Database.table('users')

const { id, name } = await query
    .select('id', 'name')
    .where({ id: 10 })
    .find()
```

#### Running a findMany query

The `findMany()` method is useful to retrieve more than one record 
that match the query statements from database:

```typescript
const query = Database.table('users')

const users = await query
    .select('id', 'name')
    .whereNull('deletedAt')
    .whereLike('name', '%Lenon%')
    .orderBy('name', 'DESC')
    .findMany()
```

#### Running a create query

The `create()` method is useful to create one record in database:

```typescript
const query = Database.table('users')

const user = await query.create({ name: 'Victor Tesoura' })
```

#### Running a createMany query

The `createMany()` method is useful to create many records in database:

```typescript
const query = Database.table('users')

const users = await query.createMany([
    { name: 'Victor Tesoura' },
    { name: 'Jo√£o Lenon' }
])
```

#### Running an update query

The `update()` method is useful to update one or more records based 
in statements in database:

```typescript
const query = Database.table('users')

const users = await query
    .select('id', 'name')
    .whereIn('id', [1, 2])
    .orderBy('name', 'ASC')
    .update({ name: 'Danrley Morais' })
```

#### Running delete query

The `delete()` method is useful to delete one or more records based 
in statements in database:

```typescript
const query = Database.table('users')

await query.whereBetween('id', [1, 10]).delete()
```

## Using multiple database connections

If your application defines multiple connections in your 
`Path.config('database.ts')` configuration file, you may access each
connection via the `connection()` method provided by the `Database` 
facade. The connection name passed to the `connection()` method should 
correspond to one of the connections listed in your 
`Path.config('database.ts')` configuration file. You also need
to explicit call the `connect()` method when working with other 
connection that is not the default:

```typescript
const query = Database.connection('mysql').table('users')

const users = await query
    .select('id', 'name')
    .whereNotIn('id', [1, 2])
    .orderBy('name', 'ASC')
    .findMany()
```

The connection created by the `connection()` method will be stored 
inside the [`DriverFactory`](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Database/blob/develop/src/factories/DriverFactory.ts)
class. This means that if you call the `connection()` method again, 
it will use the same connection created that was saved in `DriverFactory`:

```typescript
await Datatabase.connection('mysql')
    .table('users')
    .select('id', 'name')
    .whereNotIn('id', [1, 2])
    .orderBy('name', 'ASC')
    .findMany()
```

You can force `connection()` method to not save the connection 
instance in [`DriverFactory`](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Database/blob/develop/src/factories/DriverFactory.ts)
passing some properties to it:

```typescript
const database = Datatabase.connection('mysql', {
    // Force the connection to be established
    force: false,
    // Set if connection will be saved in DriverFactory
    // to be reused in all Database instances
    saveOnDriver: false
})

await database
    .table('users')
    .select('id', 'name')
    .whereNotIn('id', [1, 2])
    .orderBy('name', 'ASC')
    .findMany()
```

:::caution

If you specify to `connection()` method that you don't want to save 
the connection in driver, you will need to close the connection
using **your** database instance. We will see next how to close a 
database connection.

:::

## Closing database connections

You can simply close a connection using the `close()` or `closeAll()` 
methods of `Database` facade:

```typescript
await Database.close() // Close the default connection
await Database.connection('mysql').close() // Close the mysql connection

await Database.closeAll() // Close all the connections saved in DriverFactory
```

Remember that when creating a connection that will not be saved in 
driver, you will need to close the connection using **your** 
database instance:

```typescript
const database = Datatabase.connection('mysql', {
    force: false,
    saveOnDriver: false
})

await database
    .table('users')
    .select('id', 'name')
    .whereNotIn('id', [1, 2])
    .orderBy('name', 'ASC')
    .findMany()

// The code below will not close the connection
// created above since DriverFactory doesn't
// know what is your connection.
await Database.connection('mysql').close() // DOES NOT WORK

await database.close() // WORKS

```
