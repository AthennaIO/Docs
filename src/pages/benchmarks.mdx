# Benchmarks

All the code for benchmarks can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Benchmarks).

## Environment

```shell
npx envinfo --system --binaries

System:
    OS: macOS 12.6
    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1 Pro
    Memory: 79.86 MB / 16.00 GB
    Shell: 5.8 - /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh
  Binaries:
    Node: 16.13.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.13.1/bin/node
    npm: 8.1.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.13.1/bin/npm

```

## Results

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Framework</th>
        <th>Version</th>
        <th>Requests/sec</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Fastify</td>
        <td>3.27.4</td>
        <td>158672.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Athenna</td>
        <td>1.0.0</td>
        <td>131504.8</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

As we can see we have a big difference between Fastify and Athenna. But if you check the [code for benchmarks](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Benchmarks/tree/develop/src)
we are running Athenna from ground up using all its components and for Fastify we are just registering a GET route.
